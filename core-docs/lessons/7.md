Of course. "Geopolitical & Regulatory Navigation" is a quintessential CEO competency in the 21st century. It requires the leader to act as a diplomat, strategist, and lobbyist, navigating the complex and often conflicting systems of global powers. Failure in this domain can be catastrophic, leading to market exclusion, supply chain severance, or even the breakup of the company.

A 7-module structure is appropriate. This curriculum is designed to move from a high-level, macro understanding of the global chessboard down to the specific, operational realities of navigating international regulations and engaging with state actors.

### **Domain: Geopolitical & Regulatory Navigation**

**Core Philosophy:** A multinational corporation is a non-state actor operating within a system designed by and for nation-states. The CEO must not view the geopolitical and regulatory landscape as a mere "risk factor" or a matter for the legal department, but as a primary strategic arena. Success requires understanding the deep-seated interests of global powers and integrating that understanding into every major corporate decision.

#### **Module 1: The Global Chessboard: A CEO's Guide to Geopolitical Systems**
*   **Lesson 1.1: The Westphalian System and Corporate Sovereignty:** A foundational lesson on the concept of national sovereignty and how it defines the ultimate authority in any country a corporation operates in. This lesson explains why a contract or a patent is only as good as the legal system that enforces it.
*   **Lesson 1.2: The Three Spheres of Influence: Understanding the US, China, and EU Operating Systems:** A high-level, comparative analysis of the core interests and operating models of the world's three major economic and regulatory blocs. This covers the US focus on market capitalism and shareholder value, China's model of state-directed capitalism and social stability, and the EU's focus on stakeholder capitalism and regulatory harmonization.
*   **Lesson 1.3: The Rise of the "Geo-Economic" State:** An analysis of the modern trend where countries increasingly use economic tools (tariffs, sanctions, export controls, state-backed investment) to achieve geopolitical goals. This lesson frames international business as an extension of international relations.

#### **Module 2: Mapping Your Geopolitical Footprint**
*   **Lesson 2.1: The Geopolitical Dependency Audit:** A practical framework for conducting a full-spectrum audit of the company's geopolitical dependencies. This goes beyond a simple supply chain map to include revenue concentration by country, location of critical R&D centers, nationality of key personnel, and where customer data is stored.
*   **Lesson 2.2: Identifying Systemic Choke Points:** This lesson focuses on identifying single points of failure that are subject to geopolitical risk. Examples include reliance on a single country for a critical raw material (e.g., rare earths from China), dependence on a single manufacturing hub (e.g., semiconductors from Taiwan), or having a large revenue base in a politically volatile region.
*   **Lesson 2.3: Scenario Planning: War-Gaming Geopolitical Shocks:** A playbook for developing and war-gaming a set of realistic geopolitical scenarios (e.g., "China invades Taiwan," "The US imposes broad carbon tariffs," "A key emerging market nationalizes foreign assets"). The goal is to build institutional resilience and pre-plan strategic responses.

#### **Module 3: The Global Regulatory Maze**
*   **Lesson 3.1: The Brussels Effect: How the EU Became the World's De Facto Regulator:** An essential lesson on why EU regulations in areas like data privacy (GDPR), digital competition (DMA/DSA), and environmental standards often become the global standard, forcing multinational companies to adopt them worldwide.
*   **Lesson 3.2: Navigating Data Sovereignty and Localization Laws:** A guide to the increasingly fragmented global internet. This lesson covers the challenges of laws that require customer data to be stored within a country's borders, creating immense technical and compliance costs for global tech and finance companies.
*   **Lesson 3.3: The Global Antitrust Minefield:** An analysis of how M&A deals are no longer just subject to approval in the company's home country, but must be cleared by a gauntlet of regulators in every major market (US, EU, China, UK, etc.), each with their own priorities and political agendas.

#### **Module 4: The US-China Decoupling: A CEO's Playbook**
*   **Lesson 4.1: Understanding the US Export Control Regime (EAR & CFIUS):** A practical guide to the key US legal tools that restrict the flow of technology and capital to China. This lesson explains the critical importance of understanding these rules for any company with advanced technology or Chinese investors.
*   **Lesson 4.2: The "One Company, Two Systems" Strategy:** An analysis of the emerging corporate strategy of bifurcating technology stacks, supply chains, and even R&D teams to create separate, compliant ecosystems for the Chinese market and for the "Rest of World" market.
*   **Lesson 4.3: The Art of the "In China, for China" Narrative:** A look at the communications and branding strategy required to operate successfully in an increasingly nationalistic Chinese market, while simultaneously managing political scrutiny in the West.

#### **Module 5: The Tools of Corporate Diplomacy**
*   **Lesson 5.1: Building a Government Affairs Function:** A guide to structuring and managing a world-class government affairs and public policy team. This lesson covers how to build relationships with policymakers, trade associations, and embassies.
*   **Lesson 5.2: The CEO as Chief Diplomat:** The CEO is the company's ultimate representative on the world stage. This lesson provides a playbook for engaging with high-level government officials, understanding diplomatic protocol, and effectively advocating for the company's interests.
*   **Lesson 5.3: Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) as a Geopolitical Tool:** This lesson frames CSR and ESG initiatives not just as ethical imperatives, but as strategic tools for building goodwill, securing a "social license to operate," and aligning the company's interests with the national interests of host countries.

#### **Module 6: Navigating Emerging Markets**
*   **Lesson 6.1: Political Risk Analysis: A Framework for Emerging Markets:** A guide to assessing the unique risks of operating in countries with less stable political systems, weaker rule of law, and a higher risk of corruption. This covers using tools like political risk insurance.
*   **Lesson 6.2: The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA): A Non-Negotiable Constraint:** An essential lesson on the long arm of US law. This covers the absolute necessity of a robust anti-corruption compliance program for any company operating globally.

#### **Module 7: The CEO's Integrated Worldview**
*   **Lesson 7.1: Integrating Geopolitical Risk into Capital Allocation:** This capstone lesson connects this domain to the others. It provides a framework for how geopolitical risk should be formally incorporated into all major capital allocation decisions, whether it's building a new factory, making an acquisition, or entering a new market.
*   **Lesson 7.2: The Geopolitical Briefing: Staying Ahead of the Curve:** A guide for the CEO on how to curate a flow of high-signal information (from sources like the Council on Foreign Relations, The Economist Intelligence Unit, and specialized consultancies) to stay ahead of emerging geopolitical trends and avoid being blindsided by the next crisis.
