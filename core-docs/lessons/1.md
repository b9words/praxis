### **Domain: Mastery of Capital Allocation**

**Core Philosophy:** Capital allocation is the process of deciding how to deploy the firm's financial resources to generate the highest possible long-term value per share. Every dollar of profit a company generates presents a five-way choice. This curriculum is the study of how to make that choice, again and again, over a decade.

#### **Module 1: The CEO as an Investor: The Foundational Mindset**
*   **Lesson 1.1: The Five Choices:** A rigorous introduction to the only five things a company can do with its capital: 1) Reinvest in the core business (organic growth), 2) Acquire other businesses (inorganic growth), 3) Pay down debt, 4) Issue dividends, and 5) Buy back stock. We will frame the CEO's job as constantly evaluating the risk-adjusted return of these five options.
*   **Lesson 1.2: The Primacy of Per-Share Value:** A critical lesson on why gross revenue, profit, or market share are vanity metrics. The only long-term measure that matters is the intrinsic value per share. This module explains why a decision that grows the company but destroys per-share value is a failure of leadership.
*   **Lesson 1.3: Opportunity Cost as a Guiding Principle:** This lesson drills down on the concept that every capital allocation decision must be benchmarked against all other available options, including the simplest one: buying back your own stock. We will introduce the concept of using the company's own stock as a "hurdle rate" for all other investments.

#### **Module 2: Calculating Intrinsic Value: The Yardstick for Decision-Making**
*   **Lesson 2.1: The Owner's Earnings Framework:** Moving beyond GAAP net income to calculate a company's true, cash-generating power. This lesson focuses on Warren Buffett's concept of "Owner Earnings" (Net Income + D&A - Maintenance CapEx) as the real basis for valuation.
*   **Lesson 2.2: Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) for the CEO:** A practical guide to DCF analysis not as a precise tool, but as a framework for understanding the key levers of value: cash flow growth, long-term profitability, and risk (the discount rate).
*   **Lesson 2.3: Sanity Checking Value with Multiples:** How to use public market comparables (EV/EBITDA, P/E) and precedent transaction analysis not as a primary valuation tool, but as a crucial cross-check to ensure your intrinsic value calculation is grounded in reality.

#### **Module 3: Organic Reinvestment: Analyzing the Core Business**
*   **Lesson 3.1: The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Framework:** ROIC is the single most important metric for measuring the quality of a business and the effectiveness of its management. This lesson provides a guide to calculating and interpreting ROIC.
*   **Lesson 3.2: The Growth vs. ROIC Matrix:** A framework for making reinvestment decisions. This module explains why reinvesting in a high-ROIC business is the most powerful way to create value, and why reinvesting in a low-ROIC business destroys it, even if it leads to growth.
*   **Lesson 3.3: Maintenance CapEx vs. Growth CapEx:** A critical distinction for understanding a company's true reinvestment needs. This lesson explains how to separate the capital required to simply maintain the business from the capital being deployed to grow it, providing a clearer picture of reinvestment efficiency.

#### **Module 4: Acquisitions: The High-Stakes Path to Growth**
*   **Lesson 4.1: The Build vs. Buy Decision Framework:** A structured guide for when to pursue an acquisition. This lesson covers the key strategic rationales: acquiring technology, entering a new market, consolidating an industry, or buying a high-ROIC business to redeploy capital.
*   **Lesson 4.2: The Arithmetic of an Accretive Deal:** A non-technical explanation of accretion/dilution analysis. This lesson teaches a CEO how to quickly assess whether a deal is likely to increase or decrease earnings per share, and more importantly, why that metric can often be misleading.
*   **Lesson 4.3: The Winner's Curse and Bidding Discipline:** An analysis of the behavioral biases that lead CEOs to overpay for acquisitions. This lesson focuses on the importance of setting a firm walk-away price based on intrinsic value and maintaining discipline in a competitive auction process.

#### **Module 5: Debt Management: A Tool for Value, Not a Source of Fear**
*   **Lesson 5.1: The Role of Leverage in the Capital Structure:** This lesson explains how debt can be used strategically to magnify returns on equity (the concept of leverage). It introduces the framework of an optimal capital structure, balancing the tax advantages of debt against its financial risks.
*   **Lesson 5.2: Covenants, Credit Ratings, and Financial Flexibility:** A practical guide to the constraints that come with debt. This lesson explains how debt covenants and a company's credit rating impact its operational and strategic freedom, and why maintaining financial flexibility is a key CEO responsibility.

#### **Module 6: Share Buybacks: The Most Misunderstood Tool**
*   **Lesson 6.1: The Mathematics of a Share Repurchase:** A clear explanation of *why* buybacks increase per-share value. This lesson shows that a buyback is functionally equivalent to the company reinvesting in itself at the current market price.
*   **Lesson 6.2: The Price-Value Discipline:** The central lesson on buybacks: they are only intelligent when the company's stock is trading *below* its calculated intrinsic value. A buyback above intrinsic value destroys value just as surely as a bad acquisition.
*   **Lesson 6.3: Signaling and Market Perception:** An analysis of the non-financial aspects of buybacks. This lesson covers how buybacks are perceived by the market, their use as a signaling mechanism, and the political and social pressures surrounding them.

#### **Module 7: Dividends: The Commitment to Return Capital**
*   **Lesson 7.1: Dividends as a Signal of Stability and Discipline:** This lesson explains the role of a dividend policy in attracting a certain class of investor and imposing a sense of capital discipline on management.
*   **Lesson 7.2: The Dividend vs. Buyback Decision Framework:** A direct comparison of the two primary methods of returning capital to shareholders. This lesson covers the key differences in flexibility (dividends are hard to cut) and tax efficiency (buybacks are generally more efficient).

#### **Module 8: The Capital Allocation Plan: A Formal Document**
*   **Lesson 8.1: Codifying Your Philosophy:** This lesson guides the user in creating a formal, written Capital Allocation Plan. This document serves as a constitution for decision-making, clearly articulating the company's philosophy and priorities to the board and to investors.
*   **Lesson 8.2: Communicating the Plan in the Annual Report:** An analysis of how great capital allocators (like Buffett) use their annual shareholder letter to educate their investors about their long-term approach to capital deployment.

#### **Module 9: Measuring Performance: Scorecards for the CEO**
*   **Lesson 9.1: The Three- and Five-Year Test:** This lesson explains that the success of a capital allocation decision (especially an acquisition) cannot be judged in a single quarter. It provides a framework for evaluating the performance of major decisions over a multi-year time horizon.
*   **Lesson 9.2: Benchmarking Against the Index:** A hard-nosed look at performance. This lesson argues that if a CEO cannot generate a higher per-share value growth than a simple S&P 500 index fund over a five-year period, the shareholders would have been better off if the company had just liquidated and returned the cash.

#### **Module 10: Advanced Topics: Spinoffs, Divestitures, and Restructuring**
*   **Lesson 10.1: Spinoffs as a Tool to Unlock Value:** This lesson covers the strategic rationale for spinning off a business unit into a separate, publicly-traded company to eliminate a "conglomerate discount."
*   **Lesson 10.2: The Art of the Divestiture:** A guide to selling non-core assets. This lesson explains how selling a business unit can be a powerful act of capital allocation, freeing up resources to reinvest in the higher-ROIC core business.

#### **Module 11: The Psychology of Capital Allocation: Overcoming Bias**
*   **Lesson 11.1: The "Action Imperative": Overcoming the Bias for Empire-Building:** An analysis of the institutional pressures and personal biases that lead CEOs to favor value-destroying acquisitions over "boring" but value-creating buybacks.
*   **Lesson 11.2: Anchoring, Confirmation Bias, and the CEO:** A look at how common cognitive biases can distort major investment decisions, and the systems (like pre-mortems and formal checklists) that can be used to counteract them.

#### **Module 12: The Integrated Case Study: A CEO's First Five Years**
*   **Lesson 12.1: Year 1 - The Inheritance:** Analyzing the capital structure and investment opportunities of a newly inherited company.
*   **Lesson 12.2: Year 3 - The Crossroads:** Facing a major decision between a large acquisition, a massive buyback, and a special dividend.
*   **Lesson 12.3: Year 5 - The Reckoning:** Evaluating the results of the decisions made over the five-year period and setting the capital allocation strategy for the next five.
