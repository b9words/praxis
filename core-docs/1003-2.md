### **1. The Public Profile Page (`/profile/[username]`)**

**Goal:** To serve as a credible, shareable credential—the user's **"Praxis Dossier."** It is not a social media profile. It is a data-driven summary of their demonstrated analytical skill.

**Voice:** "The Analyst's Edge." The page should present objective data with minimal embellishment. The tone is that of a professional intelligence report.

**Key Sections & UX Writing:**

#### **1.1. Header: The Operative's Identity**
*   **UI:** Clean, professional header with a large avatar, name, and username.
*   **Key Components:**
    *   **Avatar:** `[User's Avatar Image]`
    *   **Full Name:** `John Doe`
    *   **Username (handle):** `@johndoe`
    *   **Bio:** A one-line professional summary.
        *   *UX Writing:* The label for this field in the edit view will be `"Executive Summary"` or `"Professional Brief"`, not "Bio."
    *   **Status Badge:**
        *   *UX Writing:* A small, understated badge. Examples: `"Status: Active Operative"`, `"Program Year: 2"`, `"Credential: Verified"`.
    *   **Edit/Share Buttons (Conditional):**
        *   If the viewer is the profile owner: `[ > Update Dossier ]` button.
        *   If the viewer is public: `[ > Share Dossier ]` button (copies the public URL).

#### **1.2. The Competency Matrix (The Core Credential)**
*   **Goal:** To visually represent the user's core competencies. This is the heart of the dossier.
*   **UI:** A large, clean implementation of your `PraxisRadarChart.tsx` component.
*   **Key Components & UX Writing:**
    *   **Section Title:** `"Competency Matrix"`
    *   **Subtitle:** `"Aggregate performance across all completed simulations. Last updated: [Date]"`
    *   **The Radar Chart:** The chart itself, showing the 5-10 core competencies.
    *   **Key Insight Box:** To the side of the chart, an AI-generated (or rule-based) summary of their strengths.
        *   *UX Writing (Label):* `"Analytical Strengths"`
        *   *UX Writing (Content):* `"Analysis indicates a significant aptitude in **Strategic Thinking** and **Financial Acumen**. Operative consistently excels in scenarios requiring long-term planning and quantitative analysis."` (This uses the "Analyst" voice to describe the user).

#### **1.3. Engagement History**
*   **Goal:** To provide verifiable evidence of the user's work. This is the proof behind the scores.
*   **UI:** A clean, reverse-chronological list of completed simulations.
*   **Key Components & UX Writing:**
    *   **Section Title:** `"Engagement History"`
    *   **Subtitle:** `"Log of all completed simulations and after-action reports."`
    *   **List Item (for each completed simulation):**
        *   **Title:** `"Case: Disney's Streaming Pivot (2017)"`
        *   **Date:** `"Completed: October 26, 2025"`
        *   **Performance:** A summary of the key scores for that specific simulation.
            *   *UX Writing:* `"Performance Metrics: Strategic Thinking (4.5/5), Risk Management (3.8/5)"`
        *   **Link:** A `[ > Review Debrief ]` button linking to the `/debrief/[simulationId]` page. This allows a potential employer or collaborator to see the detailed results.

#### **1.4. Privacy**
*   This entire page is only visible if the user has set their profile to "Public" in their settings. If a non-owner tries to access a private profile, they see a simple, professional message:
    *   *UX Writing:* `"This dossier is classified. Access is restricted by the operative."`

---

### **2. The Settings & Billing Pages (`/profile/edit`, `/profile/billing`, `/profile/settings/privacy`)**

**Goal:** To provide a clear, functional, and secure control panel for the user to manage their account.

**Voice:** Direct, clear, and operational. No marketing language. The tone is that of a system settings panel.

**Page Structure & UX Writing:**

#### **2.1. Edit Profile (`/profile/edit`)**
*   **Page Title:** `"Update Dossier"`
*   **Fields:**
    *   **Avatar Upload:** `[UI for avatar upload]`
    *   **Full Name:**

        *   *UX Writing (Status):* `"Status: Active"`
        *   *UX Writing (Renewal Date):* `"Renews on: November 27, 2025"`
    *   **Billing Actions:**
        *   *Button:* `[ > Manage Billing Portal ]` (This button, powered by your `handleManageBilling` action, takes them to the Paddle customer portal to update payment methods, view invoices, or cancel).
        *   *Description:* `"You will be redirected to our secure payment partner, Paddle, to manage your subscription."`
    *   **Plan Options:**
        *   *Section Title:* `"Adjust Engagement Level"`
        *   *UI:* Display the other available plans with `[ > Upgrade to Executive ]` or `[ > Downgrade to Explorer ]` buttons.

#### **2.3. Privacy & Security (`/profile/settings/privacy`)**
*   **Page Title:** `"Security & Privacy Controls"`
*   **Key Components & UX Writing:**
    *   **Profile Visibility:**
        *   *Section Title:* `"Dossier Visibility"`
        *   *UI:* A toggle switch.
        *   *Label:* `"Public Dossier"`
        *   *Description:* `"When enabled, your Praxis Dossier (including your competency matrix and engagement history) will be visible to anyone with the link. When disabled, it is classified and only visible to you."`
    *   **Data Management:**
        *   *Section Title:* `"Data Management"`
        *   *Action 1:* A `[ > Export My Data ]` button.
            *   *Description:* `"Download a JSON file containing all of your profile information, simulation history, and community contributions."`
            *   *Action:* Triggers your `/profile/settings/privacy/export/route.ts`.
        *   *Action 2:* A `[ > Request Account Deletion ]` button.
            *   *Description:* `"This will permanently delete your account and all associated data. This action is irreversible."`
            *   *Action:* Opens a confirmation modal that requires typing `"DELETE"` before the `deleteAccount` action can be triggered.

This structure ensures that the public-facing profile is an impressive and professional credential, while the private settings pages are functional, clear, and give the user complete control over their account and data.
