### **Quality Standard for a "Case Study"**

A case study is the interactive simulation where the user applies their knowledge. Its purpose is to forge judgment in the crucible of a high-stakes dilemma.

**The 3 Criteria for a Flawless Case Study:**

**1. Is it a Genuine Dilemma? (The Central Tension)**
*   A case study must not be a problem with a clear "right" answer. It must be a true dilemma—a choice between two or more valid, often painful, competing options. The user must be forced to make a trade-off.
*   **Litmus Test:** Can you articulate the core choice as a conflict between two good things (e.g., long-term growth vs. short-term profitability) or two bad things (e.g., brand damage vs. a massive financial loss)?
    *   **Bad (Fails):** "Should we fix a critical product flaw?" (The answer is obviously yes).
    *   **Good (Passes):** "Should we initiate a $500M recall for a one-in-a-million product flaw, which will wipe out our profits, or accept the small but catastrophic reputational risk of inaction?"

**2. Is it Messy? (High-Fidelity Realism)**
*   A case study must not be a sterile, clean, academic exercise. It must reflect the messy reality of business by including incomplete information, conflicting data, and political context.
*   **Litmus Test:** Does the provided "Case File" contain at least one piece of "noise" or a conflicting piece of advice from a different stakeholder?
    *   **Bad (Fails):** The case provides a single, clean spreadsheet that points to an obvious conclusion.
    *   **Good (Passes):** The case provides a financial model suggesting one course of action, but also includes a panicked email from the Head of Sales and a skeptical memo from the General Counsel that both argue for the opposite course of action.

**3. Does it Demand a Specific Artifact? (Decision Forcing)**
*   A case study must not end with a passive, multiple-choice question or a vague "What would you do?" prompt. It must force the user to perform the actual work of an executive by producing a specific, high-value artifact.
*   **Litmus Test:** Is the final output of the challenge a tangible document or model that a real executive would have to create?
    *   **Bad (Fails):** "Choose Option A, B, or C."
    *   **Good (Passes):** "Your task is to write the one-page, confidential memo to the Board of Directors, using the provided data to justify your decision to pursue Option A and reject Options B and C."
