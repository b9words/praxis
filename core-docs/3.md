### **Document 3: Content Operations Handbook**

**Product:** The Execemy Program
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Owner:** Content Team

## **1. Core Principles**

### **1.1. Philosophy**
Our content is the bedrock of the user experience. It must be **authoritative, engaging, and ruthlessly consistent.** We are not a blog; we are a structured curriculum. Every piece of content must serve the clear pedagogical goal of building a specific competency.

### **1.2. The Content Lifecycle**
All content (Articles and Cases) follows a simple, four-stage lifecycle managed within the platform's Admin Panel: `Draft` -> `In Review` -> `Approved` -> `Published`.

### **1.3. Style & Tone Guide**
*   **Voice:** Confident, clear, and direct. Like a trusted mentor or a Harvard Business Review article.
*   **Tone:** Respectful of the user's intelligence and ambition. Avoid jargon where possible, but do not dumb down complex topics.
*   **Formatting:** Use Markdown for structure. Headings, bold text, lists, and blockquotes should be used to make content highly scannable and digestible.

## **2. The Admin Panel & Content Management**

To ensure efficiency for a small team, all content operations will be managed in a dedicated, role-protected section of the web application, accessible at `/admin`.

### **2.1. Admin Dashboard**
*   **Purpose:** A central hub for the content team to see the status of the entire content library at a glance.
*   **Features:**
    *   A kanban-style board showing all `Articles` and `Cases` organized by their status (`Draft`, `In Review`, `Approved`, `Published`).
    *   A "Create New" button to initiate the creation of a new Article or Case.

### **2.2. The Content Editor**
*   **Purpose:** A unified interface for creating and editing both Articles and Cases.
*   **Features:**
    *   When creating a new piece of content, the user first selects its type: `Article` or `Case`.
    *   The editor will dynamically show the input fields required for that type, based on the templates defined below.
    *   A rich Markdown editor (e.g., a simple implementation with `react-markdown`) for the main body content.
    *   A JSON editor with validation for structured data like `datasets` and `rubrics`.
    *   A simple dropdown to manage the content's `status`. Only users with an `ADMIN` or `EDITOR` role can change the status to `Published`.

## **3. Content Framework & Templates**

These are the rigid structures for our content types. The admin editor will enforce these templates.

### **3.1. The Competency Map**
*   **Purpose:** To define the curriculum's structure. This is managed in a simple table view in the Admin Panel.
*   **Hierarchy:** `Domain` -> `Competency` -> `Micro-Skill`.
*   **Admin Action:** Admins can add, edit, or re-organize the competency map. Every `Article` must be linked to a `Micro-Skill`.

### **3.2. Article Template**
*   **Goal:** To teach a single, focused micro-skill.
*   **Fields in Admin Editor:**
    *   **`Title` (Text):** e.g., "Introduction to Discounted Cash Flow"
    *   **`Competency Link` (Dropdown):** Links to a Micro-Skill in the Competency Map.
    *   **`Content` (Markdown):** Must follow this internal structure:
        ```markdown
        ### Core Principle
        (A 1-2 paragraph explanation of the concept.)

        ### The Framework / Model
        (The formula, steps, or visual model. Can include images.)

        ### Common Pitfalls
        (A bulleted list of common mistakes to avoid.)

        ### Application Example
        (A short, concrete example of the concept in action.)
        ```

### **3.3. Case Template**
*   **Goal:** To create a realistic scenario for applying one or more competencies.
*   **Fields in Admin Editor:**
    *   **`Title` (Text):** e.g., "The Growth Engine Challenge"
    *   **`Associated Competencies` (Multi-select):** Links to the competencies being tested.
    *   **`Briefing Document` (Markdown):** The core narrative of the case. Must follow this structure:
        ```markdown
        #### The Scenario
        (The setup for the business problem.)

        #### Your Role
        (Defines the user's position and objectives.)

        #### Key Stakeholders
        (Brief bios of the AI personas the user will interact with, including their motivations and biases.)

        #### The Decision Point(s)
        (A clear outline of the choices the user must make.)
        ```
    *   **`Datasets` (JSON Editor):** Structured data for the case (e.g., `{ "financials": { "revenue": 10000, "cogs": 4000 } }`).
    *   **`Rubric` (JSON Editor):** The static rubric for the AI Coach. Must conform to a strict schema:
        ```json
        {
          "criteria": [
            {
              "competencyName": "Financial Acumen",
              "description": "Evaluates the user's ability to apply financial models correctly.",
              "scoringGuide": {
                "1": "Completely misapplied the relevant financial model.",
                "3": "Correctly applied the model but missed key nuances.",
                "5": "Flawlessly applied the model and used it to generate deep insights."
              }
            },
            {
              "competencyName": "Strategic Thinking",
              "description": "...",
              "scoringGuide": { ... }
            }
          ]
        }
        ```

## **4. Quality Control Workflow**

This simple workflow is managed using the `status` field in the Admin Panel.

1.  **Step 1: Draft (`status: 'draft'`)**
    *   A content creator clicks "Create New" in the Admin Panel.
    *   They fill out the template for the new Article or Case.
    *   They save the content. It is only visible in the Admin Panel and not to end-users.

2.  **Step 2: In Review (`status: 'in_review'`)**
    *   When the draft is complete, the creator changes its status to "In Review."
    *   This automatically notifies another team member (e.g., via a simple email trigger or just a verbal cue in a small team).
    *   The reviewer reads the content, checking it against the Style Guide and for factual accuracy. They can leave comments or make direct edits.

3.  **Step 3: Approved (`status: 'approved'`)**
    *   Once the reviewer is satisfied, they change the status to "Approved."
    *   This signals that the content is complete and ready to go live but is held for a final check.

4.  **Step 4: Published (`status: 'published'`)**
    *   A final team member (e.g., the product owner) does a last look-over.
    *   They change the status to "Published."
    *   This action makes the content immediately visible to all end-users on the platform. The database query for the main application will only ever pull content where `status = 'published'`.

### **5. MVP Content Plan**

The initial content required to launch the "Business Acumen Core" MVP.

*   **Articles to Create:**
    1.  "Framework: Return on Investment (ROI) & Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)"
    2.  "Framework: The Innovator's Dilemma"
    3.  "Framework: OPEX vs. CAPEX"

*   **Cases to Create:**
    1.  "The Growth Engine Challenge"
    2.  "The Innovation & Disruption Challenge"
    3.  "The Operational Efficiency Challenge"
