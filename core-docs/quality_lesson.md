### **Quality Standard for a "Lesson"**

A lesson is the static, "textbook-like" content that teaches a core concept or skill. Its purpose is to arm the user with a new weapon for their intellectual arsenal.

**The 3 Criteria for a Flawless Lesson:**

**1. Is it a Weapon? (Actionability)**
*   A lesson must not be a passive description of a topic. It must be a functional tool, a playbook, or a mental model that the user can immediately apply. It must be a verb, not a noun.
*   **Litmus Test:** Can you summarize the entire lesson as a "How to..." statement?
    *   **Bad (Fails):** "This lesson is about market positioning."
    *   **Good (Passes):** "This lesson teaches you *how to* use the Value Proposition Canvas to identify a competitor's weakness."

**2. Is it Grounded? (Specificity & Evidence)**
*   A lesson must not contain generic, abstract business platitudes. Every core principle must be immediately illustrated with a specific, real-world, and preferably quantitative example.
*   **Litmus Test:** Does every major point in the lesson have a corresponding, concrete example or data point?
    *   **Bad (Fails):** "It is important to have a high Return on Invested Capital."
    *   **Good (Passes):** "Domino's Pizza achieved a 70%+ ROIC by shifting to an asset-light franchise model, while a traditional restaurant might only achieve 15%. This demonstrates the power of..."

**3. Does it have a Sharp Edge? (An Opinionated Point of View)**
*   A lesson must not read like a balanced, neutral Wikipedia article. It must have the voice of an experienced operator who has seen what works and what doesn't. It should acknowledge trade-offs and offer a strong, sometimes contrarian, point of view.
*   **Litmus Test:** Does the lesson tell you not just what the framework is, but also when *not* to use it, or how it is commonly misused?
    *   **Bad (Fails):** "OKRs are a popular goal-setting system used by many companies."
    *   **Good (Passes):** "The most common failure mode for OKRs is cascading them too deeply into the organization, turning them into a bureaucratic checklist. They should be used for alignment on a few key priorities, not as a comprehensive task manager."
