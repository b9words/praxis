### **Redesigned Onboarding Flow: The Induction (v2)**

**Core Principle:** The onboarding is a multi-stage assessment. It diagnoses the user's objective, identifies their core competency gap, secures their resource commitment (subscription), and issues their first clear mission (the first lesson). The language is consistently analytical, respectful, and framed in scenarios.

---

#### **Step 1: The Situation Briefing**

**Goal:** To frame the user's ambition as a specific, high-stakes scenario, immediately establishing the "Speak in Scenarios" principle.

**UX:** A single, focused screen. The UI is minimalist and text-centric, like a classified document.

**(Screen Appears Immediately After Signup)**

> **[UI: A blinking cursor next to the first line, as if a document is being written in real-time]**
>
> ---
>
> **SUBJECT: Initial Assessment**
>
> **STATUS: Pending Operative Input**
>
> We begin by defining the strategic challenge. Every leader's journey starts with a clear-eyed assessment of their current position and their desired end-state.
>
> Consider your career as a company. You have assets, liabilities, and a competitive landscape.
>
> **Describe the strategic objective of your "company." What market are you trying to win in the next five years?**
>
> **[UI: A single, clean textarea input field. Placeholder text reads: "Example: To transition from a senior engineering role to leading a new product division... or... To secure a Series A for my B2B SaaS startup..."]**
>
> `[__________________________________________________________________]`
>
> **[UI: A single, understated button below the textarea]**
> `[ > Log Assessment ]`

**Why This Works:**
*   **Voice:** Immediately introduces "The Analyst's Edge" with terms like "Operative" and "Strategic Challenge."
*   **Speak in Scenarios:** It frames their personal goal as a strategic business problem.
*   **Respect the Intellect:** It doesn't ask "What are your goals?"; it asks them to perform an analysis.

#### **Step 2: The Diagnostic**

**Goal:** To map the user's stated objective to a core competency gap, labeling the choice as a strategic resource allocation decision.

**UX:** A focused, multi-choice screen that feels like a strategic triage, not a feature selection.

**(Screen appears after Step 1 is submitted)**

> **[UI: The user's input from Step 1 is displayed at the top, now locked and labeled "Logged Objective"]**
>
> ---
>
> **SUBJECT: Resource Allocation**
>
> **ANALYSIS: Acknowledged.** Achieving this objective requires closing a critical competency gap. A leader's primary function is to allocate their most limited resource—time—against the highest-leverage opportunity.
>
> We will now allocate your initial training resources.
>
> **Based on your objective, which of these 10 core competencies represents your most significant current gap?**
>
> **[UI: A clean, 2-column list of the 10 core competencies. Each is a clickable card. When hovered, a brief description appears.]**
>
> *   `[ ] Mastery of Capital Allocation`
> *   `[ ] Competitive Moat Architecture`
> *   `[ ] Global Systems Thinking`
> *   `[ ] Organizational Design & Talent Density`
> *   `[ ] High-Stakes Dealmaking & Integration`
> *   `[ ] Investor & Market Narrative Control`
> *   `[ ] Geopolitical & Regulatory Navigation`
> *   `[ ] Crisis Leadership & Public Composure`
> *   `[ ] Second-Order Decision Making`
> *   `[ ] Technological & Market Foresight`
>
> **[UI: A "Confirm Allocation" button becomes active only after a selection is made.]**
> `[ > Confirm Allocation ]`

**Why This Works:**
*   **Voice:** Reinforces the Analyst voice with "Resource Allocation," "Competency Gap," and "Highest-Leverage Opportunity."
*   **Label the Mental Model:** It explicitly labels their choice as a "resource allocation" decision.
*   **Respect the Intellect:** It frames them as a capable analyst of their own skills.

#### **Step 3: The Commitment**

**Goal:** To frame the subscription not as a payment, but as the final resource commitment required to activate the program.

**UX:** A clean pricing page that feels like a contract or a commitment form rather than a marketing page. The previously selected competency informs the text.

**(Screen appears after Step 2 is submitted)**

> **[UI: The user's choice from Step 2 is displayed at the top, e.g., "Allocation Confirmed: Competitive Moat Architecture"]**
>
> ---
>
> **SUBJECT: Finalizing Resource Commitment**
>
> **STATUS: Awaiting Authorization**
>
> **ANALYSIS:** Your training resources are allocated. Your first deployment is calculated. One final action is required to activate the program.
>
> Success in any high-stakes endeavor requires a commitment of resources. This is the point of no return. Choose your engagement level to proceed.
>
> **[UI: The pricing cards from your `/pricing` page are displayed here, but with slightly different button text and context. The "Professional" or most popular plan is highlighted.]**
>
> **[Example Plan Card]**
>
> > **Professional Plan**
> >
> > `$99 / month`
> >
> > *   Access to Years 1-3 curriculum (39 articles, 10 cases)
> > *   AI-powered performance debriefs
> > *   Verified Praxis credential
> > *   ...
> >
> > **[UI: Button for the card]**
> > `[ > Authorize Professional Plan ]`
>
> **[UI: Below the pricing cards, a small, reassuring line of text.]**
>
> `All plans include a 30-day evaluation period. Full refund if the program does not meet your analytical standards.`

**Why This Works:**
*   **Voice:** It uses terms like "Resource Commitment," "Awaiting Authorization," and "Engagement Level." The refund policy is framed as an "evaluation period" that respects their analytical judgment ("analytical standards").
*   **Strategic Framing:** The purchase is positioned as the final, logical step in a strategic process they have already begun, not as an emotional buying decision.
*   **Contextual Buttons:** The button text "Authorize Plan" feels more professional and less transactional than "Buy Now."

#### **Step 4: The First Clear Step**

**Goal:** To deliver immediate, personalized value based on the user's diagnostic, confirming their commitment was worthwhile and providing a clear, actionable starting point.

**UX:** The final screen of the onboarding flow. A "mission briefing" that transitions them directly into the platform.

**(Screen appears after successful payment in Step 3)**

> **[UI: A confirmation message at the top, e.g., "Authorization Complete. Welcome, Operative."]**
>
> ---
>
> **SUBJECT: Initial Deployment**
>
> **ACTION: Acknowledged.** Your initial focus will be on **Competitive Moat Architecture**. This is a high-leverage choice. Understanding structural advantage is the foundation of all durable strategy.
>
> Before you can build a moat, you must learn to identify one.
>
> **Your first clear step is a foundational lesson:**
>
> **[UI: A single, prominent card for the first lesson of the selected domain. It feels like a real object, not just a link.]**
>
> > **[Thumbnail Image for the Lesson]**
> >
> > **Domain:** Competitive Moat Architecture
> >
> > **Lesson 1.1:** Defining the Moat: Differentiating True Moats from Fleeting Advantages
> >
> > **Brief:** A critical first lesson on the difference between a durable, structural advantage and temporary advantages. The primary litmus test: does this advantage protect long-term profits?
>
> **[UI: A single, primary call-to-action button.]**
> `[ > Begin Analysis ]`

**Why This Works:**
*   **Voice:** The confirmation "Welcome, Operative" and the briefing "Initial Deployment" completes their induction.
*   **Respect the Intellect:** The phrase "This is a high-leverage choice" validates their decision.
*   **Immediate Value:** It doesn't dump them on a generic dashboard. It provides a specific, personalized, and actionable starting point as a direct reward for their commitment. The button `Begin Analysis` frames the act of learning as an active, analytical task.
