### **Document 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD)**

**Product:** The Execemy Program
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 28, 2025
**Owner:** Product Team

## **1. Vision & Strategy**

### **1.1. Mission**
To provide a **proving ground** for the next generation of ambitious leaders. We help our members systematically build and demonstrate the business acumen required to lead a world-class organization by combining a simulation platform, a private network, and a skills-based credential.

### **1.2. The Core Problem**
Ambitious individuals (students, career-switchers, aspiring entrepreneurs) lack a structured, practical, and credible way to develop and signal their business decision-making abilities. Traditional methods are passive (courses, books) or inaccessible (elite MBA programs, on-the-job experience).

### **1.3. Target Audience (The Member Persona)**
*   **"The Ambitious Professional":** 25-35 years old. Works in a non-business role (e.g., engineering, design, science) at a top company. Highly intelligent and motivated, but feels their career is constrained by a lack of formal business and financial literacy. They want to move into product management, strategy, or start their own company one day. They consume business news voraciously but struggle to apply its lessons.

### **1.4. Strategic Pillars**
1.  **Simulation over Information:** We prioritize applied learning through interactive simulations over passive content consumption.
2.  **Community as a Moat:** The network of vetted, high-quality members is a core part of the product's value.
3.  **Skills as a Signal:** The ultimate output is a credible, verifiable credential (The Execemy Profile) that demonstrates a member's competence.

## **2. User Journey & Flows**

### **2.1. The Member Lifecycle**

1.  **Awareness:** Discovers the Execemy Program through a nomination from a trusted creator, a post from a current member, or targeted content.
2.  **Application:** Lands on a public-facing site that emphasizes exclusivity and transformation. Submits a short application to signal intent and quality.
3.  **Onboarding:** Upon acceptance and payment, the user is guided through setting up their profile and introduced to the core concepts of the program.
4.  **Engagement:** The member engages in the core loop:
    *   **Learn:** Engages with the Competency Library.
    *   **Practice:** Completes a Case Simulation.
    *   **Debrief:** Reviews their AI-generated performance on the Debriefing Hub.
    *   **Connect:** Discusses the simulation and other topics in the private community.
5.  **Signaling:** The member improves their Execemy Profile and chooses to share it publicly on their LinkedIn or personal website.
6.  **Advocacy:** Becomes a proponent of the program, sharing their results and encouraging others to apply.

## **3. Feature Specifications**

### **3.1. Core Platform Features**

#### **3.1.1. The Execemy Profile (The Credential)**
*   **Description:** The member's public-facing, dynamic skills profile. This is the central hub for their identity and progress within the program.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Must display the member's name, avatar, and a short bio.
    *   Must feature a prominent **Execemy Score Radar Chart**, visualizing their proficiency across the five core competencies: `Financial Acumen`, `Strategic Thinking`, `Market Awareness`, `Risk Management`, and `Leadership Judgment`.
    *   Must include a timeline or log of all completed simulations and the specific scores achieved on each.
    *   Users must have a simple toggle to switch their profile from `Private` to `Public`.
    *   Public profiles will have a unique, shareable URL (e.g., `praxis.program/profile/username`).

#### **3.1.2. The Dashboard (The Home Base)**
*   **Description:** The primary landing page for a logged-in member. It serves as a launchpad for all activities.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Must prominently display a snapshot of the member's current Execemy Profile Radar Chart.
    *   Must feature a "Recommended Next Step" component, suggesting the next simulation in their chosen Residency path.
    *   Must include a "Community Feed" widget showing the latest discussions from the community forum.
    *   Must have a clear navigation bar providing access to the Library, Simulations, their Profile, and the Community.

### **3.2. Module 1: The Competency Library (The "Learn" Module)**

*   **Description:** The quality-controlled knowledge base.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   The UI must present the curriculum as a clear hierarchy: `Residency -> Domain -> Competency -> Article`.
    *   **Article View:**
        *   A clean, reader-focused interface for the static article content.
        *   Must include a "Key Takeaways" section at the top.
        *   Must include an integrated **"Smart Study Assistant"**:
            *   This is an AI chat interface present on the article page.
            *   Users can ask clarifying questions about the article's content.
            *   The AI's responses must be strictly constrained to the information present in that single article.

### **3.3. Module 2: The Case Simulation Engine (The "Practice" Module)**

*   **Description:** The interactive core of the platform where members apply knowledge.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **Case Briefing Page:** Before starting a simulation, the user is presented with the complete, static case file (the narrative, key players, datasets).
    *   **Simulation Interface:**
        *   A persistent, two-panel layout. The left panel contains all case files and data (`.md`, `.json` viewers). The right panel is the interactive "workspace."
        *   **Decision Points:** The simulation progresses through a series of pre-defined decision points. At each point, the user must submit a written justification for their choice.
        *   **Role-Play Engine:**
            *   Certain decision points will require the user to interact with an AI persona (e.g., "Negotiate with the target CEO," "Convince your CFO").
            *   This interaction will happen in a chat interface within the workspace.
            *   The AI's persona, motivations, and knowledge are strictly defined by the static case file.

### **3.4. Module 3: The Performance Debriefing Hub (The "Debrief" Module)**

*   **Description:** The feedback loop where learning is analyzed and consolidated.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Upon completing a simulation, the user is immediately taken to their Debrief page.
    *   The page must be visually impactful and feel like a significant reward.
    *   It must display the user's scores for each of the core competencies, based on the AI Coach's analysis against the static rubric.
    *   It must provide **specific, actionable feedback** for each scored competency, linking back to the relevant principles in the Competency Library. Example: *"Your Financial Acumen score was 3/5. Your ROI calculation was accurate, but you failed to account for the 'sunk cost' fallacy in your justification. Review the 'Capital Budgeting Pitfalls' article to learn more."*
    *   The Debrief page must clearly show how the results of this simulation have impacted the user's overall Execemy Profile Radar Chart.

### **3.5. The Community (The "Connect" Module)**

*   **Description:** The private, members-only network.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Must be a forum-style interface with channels dedicated to specific topics (e.g., `#simulation-debriefs`, `#business-news`, `#career-paths`).
    *   Member profiles within the community must link back to their full Execemy Profile.
    *   The platform must support threaded conversations and user mentions.
    *   A "Leaderboard" section will show top performers for specific simulations, creating aspiration and competition.
