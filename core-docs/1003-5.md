### **Part 1: SEO & Metadata Foundation**

Your goal is to ensure that when your platform is shared or discovered, it looks professional and authoritative. This is controlled by a robust metadata strategy.

**Technical Implementation:** Use Next.js's built-in Metadata API. You will use the `generateMetadata` function in your `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files for dynamic pages.

**Action Plan:**

1.  **Global Metadata (`app/layout.tsx`):**
    *   Set the foundational metadata for the entire site. This is your default.
    *   **`metadataBase`:** Set this to your production URL (e.g., `new URL('https://www.praxisprogram.com')`). This is critical for making sure all relative image paths work correctly.
    *   **`title.template`:** Set a template for your page titles. Example: `%s | Praxis Program`.
    *   **`description`:** A high-level, compelling description of the platform.
    *   **`openGraph`:**
        *   `title`, `description`: Mirror the main ones.
        *   `url`: Your canonical site URL.
        *   `siteName`: "Praxis Program".
        *   `images`: Provide a default, high-quality social sharing image (1200x630 pixels) representing your brand. This is your fallback image.
        *   `locale`: `en_US`.
        *   `type`: `website`.
    *   **`twitter`:**
        *   `card`: `summary_large_image`.
        *   `title`, `description`, `images`: Mirror the Open Graph ones.
        *   `creator`: `@[YourTwitterHandle]`.

2.  **Dynamic Metadata for Public Profiles (`app/(app)/profile/[username]/page.tsx`):**
    *   This is crucial for making profiles shareable.
    *   Use `generateMetadata` to fetch the specific user's profile data.
    *   **`title`:** `${profile.fullName || profile.username}'s Praxis Dossier`.
    *   **`description`:** A summary of their status. Example: `"View ${profile.fullName}'s professional dossier, including their competency matrix and a history of completed business simulations."`
    *   **`openGraph` & `twitter`:**
        *   Dynamically generate a unique image for each profile. **Solution:** Create a dedicated API route (`/api/og/profile/[username]`) that uses `satori` (which you're already using for thumbnails) to render a custom image with the user's name, avatar, and a mini radar chart. This is a massive "wow" factor when shared.

3.  **Dynamic Metadata for The Intelligence Briefing (`app/(marketing)/briefing/page.tsx`):**
    *   Use `generateMetadata` to fetch the current week's free module.
    *   **`title`:** `This Week's Briefing: [Module Title]`.
    *   **`description`:** `Access a complimentary module from the Praxis curriculum, including all lessons and a practice case study on [Module Topic].`
    *   **`openGraph` & `twitter`:** Generate a dynamic image for the briefing using the same `satori`-based API route technique, showing the module title and domain.

4.  **Static Page Metadata:**
    *   Add a `metadata` export to all your static marketing pages (`/about`, `/pricing`, `/legal/...`) with specific, relevant titles and descriptions.

5.  **Favicons, `robots.txt`, and `sitemap.xml`:**
    *   **Favicons:** Use a service like [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate a comprehensive set of favicons (`favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, etc.) and place them in your `app/` directory. Next.js will automatically pick them up.
    *   **`robots.txt`:** Create `app/robots.ts`. Disallow crawlers from accessing authenticated routes (`/dashboard`, `/simulations`, `/debrief`), admin routes (`/admin`), and API routes (`/api`). Allow access to all marketing pages.
    *   **`sitemap.xml`:** Create `app/sitemap.ts`. Dynamically generate a sitemap that includes your core marketing pages and—importantly—the URLs of all **publicly visible user profiles.** This signals to Google that these are important pages to index.
