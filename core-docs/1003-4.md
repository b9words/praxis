Excellent. This is a classic and highly effective "freemium" or "content sampling" strategy. You're moving beyond a simple paywall to create a dynamic, engaging lead generation engine. The goal is to find the perfect balance: provide enough real, tangible value to demonstrate the platform's quality and create a habit, but hold back just enough to make the subscription a compelling and necessary next step.

Let's design a system called **"The Weekly Intelligence Briefing."** It's framed not as a "free trial," but as a curated, public-facing briefing—aligning perfectly with your "Analyst's Edge" voice.

### **Part 1: The Strategic Sweet Spot**

The sweet spot is not about quantity, but about providing a complete, satisfying "loop" that showcases the entire value proposition of the platform.

**The "Weekly Intelligence Briefing" Offer:**
*   **One Full Learning Module:** Each week, one specific Module from the curriculum (e.g., "The CEO as an Investor: The Foundational Mindset") is made publicly accessible.
*   **All Associated Lessons:** This includes all 2-4 lessons within that module. Users can read the full, high-quality markdown content.
*   **One Associated "Practice" Case Study:** A single, relevant case study that allows users to apply the knowledge from the free lessons is also made available.
*   **Limited Simulation & No Debrief:** Crucially, non-subscribed users can *start* the case study and interact with the first stage, but to proceed further or, most importantly, to **get their performance debrief and see their scores**, they must subscribe.

**Why this is the perfect sweet spot:**

1.  **Demonstrates Full Value Loop:** It lets users experience the entire `Learn -> Practice -> ???` flow. They get the satisfaction of learning and applying, but are left with the critical, unanswered question: "How did I do?" The debrief becomes the ultimate incentive to convert.
2.  **Creates Urgency & Habit:** The content rotates weekly (or every few days). This creates a reason to come back ("What's in this week's briefing?"). It also creates FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) on a particularly interesting module.
3.  **Highlights Quality Over Quantity:** Instead of a scattered sample of 10 random articles, you provide a deep, cohesive learning experience on a single topic. This better demonstrates the structured, systematic nature of your curriculum.
4.  **Minimizes "Content Grazing":** By focusing on one module at a time, it prevents users from consuming all the "greatest hits" across the curriculum without ever subscribing.

### **Part 2: The "Cyborg" Curation & Rotation System**

We will design a simple, scalable system for managing what's free each week. It will be an AI-assisted manual process, giving you full control with minimal effort.

**The System:**

1.  **The "Briefing Schedule" (`content/briefing-schedule.json`):**
    *   This is a simple, static JSON file in your content directory that you manage. It's a queue of upcoming free modules. This gives you long-term control over the content rotation.
    *   **Structure:**
        ```json
        [
          { "week_of": "2025-11-10", "domain_id": "capital-allocation", "module_id": "ceo-as-investor", "case_id": "cs_unit_economics_crisis" },
          { "week_of": "2025-11-17", "domain_id": "competitive-moat-architecture", "module_id": "foundational-theory", "case_id": "cs_skill_01_asymmetric_warfare" },
          // ... more weeks
        ]
        ```

2.  **The `getCurrentBriefing` Helper (`lib/content-loader.ts`):**
    *   **Logic:** This server-side function reads the `briefing-schedule.json`. It finds the entry whose `week_of` date is the most recent one in the past.
    *   **Output:** It returns an object containing the `domain_id`, `module_id`, and `case_id` for the currently active free content.

3.  **The `getPublicAccessStatus` Function (`lib/auth/authorize.ts`):**
    *   **Logic:** This is the core authorization function. It takes a `userId` (which can be `null`) and the `domainId`, `moduleId`, `lessonId`, or `caseId` of the content being requested.
        1.  It first checks if the user is authenticated and has an active subscription. If so, it returns `{ access: true }`.
        2.  If not, it calls `getCurrentBriefing()` to get the current week's free content.
        3.  It then checks if the requested content is part of the free module or is the free case study. If it is, it returns `{ access: true, isPublic: true }`.
        4.  Otherwise, it returns `{ access: false }`.

### **Part 3: The Technical & UX Implementation**

Here’s how to integrate this system into your platform without over-engineering.

#### **1. Data Layer Changes:**

*   **`content/briefing-schedule.json`:** Create this file. You can pre-populate it for the next 6-12 months.
*   **`lib/content-loader.ts`:** Implement the `getCurrentBriefing()` function. This is a simple file read and date comparison.
*   **`lib/auth/authorize.ts`:** Implement the `getPublicAccessStatus()` function. This will become your central logic for all content access.

#### **2. Backend & API Changes:**

*   **Protect Your Routes:** In every page that displays content (e.g., `app/(app)/library/curriculum/[...]/page.tsx`, `app/(app)/simulations/[caseId]/brief/page.tsx`), you will call `getPublicAccessStatus()`. If `access` is `false`, you redirect the user to a paywall page.

#### **3. Frontend & UX Changes:**

This is where you lure users in.

1.  **The Public-Facing "Intelligence Briefing" Page (`app/(marketing)/briefing/page.tsx`):**
    *   **Purpose:** A dedicated landing page for this feature.
    *   **Content:**
        *   *Headline:* `"This Week's Intelligence Briefing"`
        *   *Subtitle:* `"Each week, our analysts release one module from the Praxis curriculum for public review. Access is complimentary."`
        *   **UI:** It dynamically loads the content for the current free module. It displays the module title, description, and cards for each lesson and the associated case study. These cards link directly to the content pages.
    *   **CTA:** A prominent `[ > Unlock the Full Curriculum ]` button linking to `/pricing`.

2.  **Modified Content Pages for Public Users:**
    *   When a non-subscribed user views a free lesson, the page is almost identical to the subscribed view. The key difference is a **persistent, non-intrusive banner** at the top or bottom of the page.
        *   *UX Writing:* `"You are viewing content from this week's Intelligence Briefing. [Unlock all 219 lessons] with a Praxis subscription."`
    *   Case study pages (`/simulations/[caseId]/brief`) will look normal. The `workspace` page is where the paywall hits.

3.  **The "Soft" Paywall in the Simulator (`SimulationWorkspace.tsx`):**
    *   **Logic:** Inside the `SimulationWorkspace`, check the user's status.
    *   **UX:** If the user is not subscribed:
        *   They can fully interact with Stage 1 of the simulation.
        *   The `[ > Submit & Continue ]` button is replaced with a `[ > Submit & View Analysis ]` button.
        *   When they click this button, a modal appears.
    *   **The Paywall Modal:**
        *   *Headline (Label the Mental Model):* `"The Analyst's Debrief is a Classified Asset"`
        *   *Body Text:* `"You have successfully completed the first stage. Your decisions have been logged. To receive your full performance debrief—including your competency scores and a breakdown of your strategic errors—you must be an active operative."`
        *   *Key Insight:* It shows a "blurred" or "redacted" preview of the radar chart. This is incredibly compelling.
        *   *Buttons:* `[ > Authorize Plan & Reveal Debrief ]` (links to `/pricing`) and a smaller `[ Continue without analysis ]` (closes modal).

This system achieves the perfect balance. It provides real value, creates a weekly habit, showcases your product's core loop, and presents a powerful, psychologically compelling reason to subscribe right at the moment of highest user intent.
