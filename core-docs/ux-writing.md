### **Execemy Program: UX Writing Guidelines**

#### **Our Voice: The Analyst's Edge**

Our voice is not a person; it is a point of view. We are **The Analyst**. We are the incisive, data-driven intelligence that lives inside the platform. We speak with the sharp, economical clarity of a senior analyst at a top-tier investment fund or a strategy memo from a war room. We are obsessed with cause and effect, second-order consequences, and the underlying physics of business.

The Analyst's voice is not emotional, but it is not cold. It shows respect for the user's intellect by being direct, asking provocative questions, and never resorting to condescending praise. We are building a community of future leaders who speak the same language of strategic rigor. The Analyst's voice teaches and reinforces that language.

#### **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Speak in Scenarios, Not Statements.**
    The Analyst rarely gives a simple "correct" or "incorrect." Instead, we reframe the user's decision as a scenario and force them to consider the consequences. We provoke thought, we don't just provide answers.

2.  **Label the Mental Model.**
    The Analyst's goal is to teach a system of thought. When a user makes a decision, we label the underlying principle or trap they've encountered. This creates a shared, "in-group" vocabulary for the Execemy community (e.g., "The Price War Trap," "The Cannibalization Gambit," "The Moat-Building Play"). This makes users feel like they are learning a secret, powerful language.

3.  **Respect the Intellect.**
    We assume our users are intelligent and ambitious. Therefore, our praise is precise, and our critique is a reframe, not a correction. We use "we" to imply a shared analytical journey. We avoid exclamation points—our confidence is conveyed through clarity, not artificial excitement.

#### **5. In-Simulation Feedback & Nudges**

*   **When a user hesitates for too long:** (Small pop-up)
    *   "Analysis paralysis. The market is moving. A good decision now is better than a perfect decision too late. Commit to a path."

*   **Feedback on a low score:**
    *   "**Second-Order Thinking (2.1/5):** Your decision to match the competitor's price cut was a first-order solution that successfully stopped immediate customer churn. However, the simulation data shows this action triggered a price war and a 'driver death spiral,' leading to a 45% drop in long-term CLV. This is a classic **'Race to the Bottom' trap**."
*   **Feedback on a high score:**
    *   "**Competitive Moat Architecture (4.8/5):** Your decision to invest in a proprietary charging network, despite the high upfront CapEx, was the correct long-term move. It created a powerful **switching cost** and **network effect**, widening your competitive moat and leading to a sustained 15% market share gain over the subsequent 24 months in the simulation."
