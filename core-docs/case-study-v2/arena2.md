### **Arena 2: The Deal Room - 20 Case Study Blueprints**

#### **Core Competency: M&A Valuation & Analysis**

**1. Title: The "Acqui-Hire" Valuation**
*   **Competency:** M&A Valuation & Analysis
*   **Challenge Type:** The "Back of the Envelope" Model
*   **Dilemma:** A brilliant, 10-person AI research startup with no revenue and no commercial product is being courted by several tech giants. Your company needs to make a competitive offer to acquire the team.
*   **Task:** The startup has no cash flow to discount. Your task is to build a valuation model from scratch based on talent value, not financial performance. The model must quantify the "build vs. buy" decision by estimating the cost, time, and probability of success of building a similar world-class team internally. This is your justification for a multi-million dollar offer.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Team Profiles]` Detailed profiles of the 10 PhDs on the startup team, including their publications and previous work.
    *   `[Market Data]` Data on recent salaries and signing bonuses for top-tier AI talent.
    *   `[Internal Memo]` A memo from your Head of R&D detailing the failure of your last internal project in this space.

**2. Title: The "Sum-of-the-Parts" Breakup**
*   **Competency:** M&A Valuation & Analysis
*   **Challenge Type:** The S-1 Teardown
*   **Dilemma:** A legacy media conglomerate is trading at a significant discount to what an activist investor believes its individual assets are worth. The company consists of a declining but cash-generative broadcast network, a valuable movie studio IP library, a growing theme park division, and a money-losing streaming service.
*   **Task:** You are the activist investor. Analyze the provided segment-level financial data for each of the four divisions. Your task is to produce a detailed valuation report. You must apply different valuation multiples (e.g., EBITDA multiples for the network, revenue multiples for the streaming service) to each part to argue that the sum of the parts is worth significantly more than the current stock price, making a breakup the only logical path.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[10-K Filing]` The company's most recent annual report, with detailed financial breakdowns for each business segment.
    *   `[Market Data]` A list of recent transaction multiples for comparable companies in each of the four segments.

**3. Title: The "Synergy" Sanity Check**
*   **Competency:** M&A Valuation & Analysis
*   **Challenge Type:** The Pre-Mortem Red Team
*   **Dilemma:** Your CEO is championing a massive "merger of equals" with your largest competitor. The investment bankers have presented a model showing billions in projected cost and revenue synergies, justifying a huge premium. You, as the Head of Strategy, are deeply skeptical.
*   **Task:** Write a confidential Red Team analysis of the synergy projections. Your task is to go line by line through the bankers' assumptions (e.g., "reduce redundant headcount by 30%," "cross-sell products to new customers") and systematically dismantle them. You must identify the operational, cultural, and technical hurdles that will make achieving these synergies far more difficult and expensive than projected.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Banker's Deck]` The investment bank's glossy presentation detailing the synergy opportunities.
    *   `[Org Charts]` The detailed organizational charts for both companies.

**4. Title: The Distressed Asset Acquisition**
*   **Competency:** M&A Valuation & Analysis
*   **Challenge Type:** The Forensic Audit
*   **Dilemma:** A promising competitor has just declared bankruptcy. Their core technology is valuable, but their finances are a complete mess. You have the opportunity to acquire their assets out of bankruptcy for a potentially low price, but the risks are immense.
*   **Task:** You are given access to the bankrupt company's "data room," containing messy financial statements, a list of outstanding liabilities, and key employee contracts. Your task is to conduct a rapid forensic audit. You must produce a report that separates the valuable "clean" assets from the toxic liabilities and determines a safe, defensible bidding price.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Financials]` The target company's incomplete and chaotic financial statements.
    *   `[Legal Docs]` A summary of their outstanding debts and legal obligations.

*   **Challenge Type:** The Redline Negotiation
*   **Dilemma:** You are the founder of a promising startup. You have just received a Series A term sheet from a top-tier, aggressive venture capital firm. The valuation is good, but the terms seem punitive.
*   **Task:** You are presented with the full VC term sheet. Your task is to redline three key clauses: the `Liquidation Preference` (e.g., changing it from 2x participating to 1x non-participating), the composition of the `Board of Directors`, and the scope of the founder's `Vesting Schedule`. You must write a concise, professional justification for each of your counter-proposals.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Term Sheet]` The full, legally-worded venture capital term sheet.

*   **Competency:** Deal Structuring & Negotiation
*   **Challenge Type:** The High-Stakes Negotiation
*   **Dilemma:** You are trying to acquire a founder-led company. You and the founder are far apart on valuation. The only way to bridge the gap is to propose an "earn-out," where the founder will receive additional payments based on hitting certain performance targets post-acquisition.
*   **Task:** You enter a turn-based negotiation simulation with the AI-powered "Founder." Your goal is to structure a multi-year earn-out agreement. The negotiation will focus on the key metrics (Revenue vs. Profit?), the targets (Ambitious vs. Realistic?), and the founder's post-deal autonomy.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Financials]` The target company's historical financials.
    *   `[Founder Profile]` A psychological profile of the founder, highlighting their distrust of corporate bureaucracy.

*   **Competency:** Deal Structuring & Negotiation
*   **Challenge Type:** The Investment Committee Memo
*   **Dilemma:** You are the CEO of a conglomerate and have decided to divest a non-core division. You have two options: sell the division to a private equity firm for a fixed cash price, or spin it off to your existing shareholders as a new, independent public company.
*   **Task:** Write a memo to your board recommending one path over the other. Your analysis must compare the two options across several key criteria: immediate cash value, tax efficiency, speed of execution, and the potential for long-term upside for your shareholders.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[PE Offer]` A formal, binding offer letter from the private equity firm.
    *   `[Banker's Analysis]` An investment bank's analysis of the potential market valuation of the division as a standalone public company.

*   **Competency:** Deal Structuring & Negotiation
*   **Challenge Type:** The Redline Negotiation
*   **Dilemma:** Your company is entering into a 50/50 joint venture with a large foreign corporation to enter the Chinese market. The negotiation is stalled on one critical issue: who has ultimate control over the JV's intellectual property.
*   **Task:** You are presented with the IP section of the JV agreement. The foreign partner's redline gives them ownership of all IP developed *in* China. Your task is to redline this clause and propose a new structure (e.g., a complex cross-licensing agreement) that protects your company's core global IP while still allowing the JV to succeed.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[JV Agreement]` The draft legal agreement with the contentious IP clause.
    *   `[Memo]` A memo from your CTO explaining the long-term risks of losing control of the IP.

#### **Core Competency: Post-Merger Integration (PMI)**

**9. Title: The Culture Clash**
*   **Competency:** Post-Merger Integration
*   **Challenge Type:** The First 100 Days Plan
*   **Dilemma:** Your nimble, fast-moving tech company has just been acquired by a massive, slow-moving industrial conglomerate. You, the founder of the acquired company, have been put in charge of the integration. The parent company wants to immediately impose its corporate processes (like performance reviews and budget approvals) on your team.
*   **Task:** Create a 100-day plan focused entirely on protecting your team's culture and autonomy. The plan must detail which parent company processes you will accept, which you will fight against, and how you will manage the relationship with your new corporate overseers to prevent your high-performing team from quitting en masse.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Integration Mandate]` The official memo from the parent company CEO outlining the goals of the integration.
    *   `[Employee Survey]` Pre-acquisition survey data on your team's values (speed, autonomy, impact).

**10. Title: The "Synergy" Capture Plan**
*   **Competency:** Post-Merger Integration
*   **Challenge Type:** The Capital Allocation Stack Rank
*   **Dilemma:** You have just completed a major merger with a competitor. The deal was justified to Wall Street based on achieving $500 million in annual cost synergies. Now you have to actually find those savings.
*   **Task:** You are the head of the Integration Management Office. You are presented with five major synergy proposals from different departments (e.g., consolidating data centers, combining sales forces, rationalizing overlapping products). Each proposal has a projected savings amount, an implementation cost, and a "risk of disruption" score. Your task is to greenlight a portfolio of projects that meets the $500M target while minimizing the risk to the business.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Synergy Proposals]` The five detailed project proposals.
    *   `[Banker's Deck]` The original investment bank presentation that promised the $500M in synergies.

*   **Competency:** Post-Merger Integration
*   **Challenge Type:** The Pre-Mortem Red Team
*   **Dilemma:** You have acquired a company with a product that directly competes with one of your own. Both products have loyal customer bases. The combined engineering team has created a complex, 18-month roadmap to merge the two products into a single "best of both" platform.
*   **Task:** You are the CEO. You believe this "merge" strategy is a recipe for disaster that will alienate both customer bases and result in a bloated, unfocused product. Your task is to write a Red Team analysis that kills this plan. You must argue for a more decisive (and painful) strategy: pick one product as the winner and create a plan to migrate the other product's customers, even at the risk of some short-term churn.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Product Roadmaps]` The roadmaps for both legacy products and the proposed merged product.
    *   `[Customer Data]` Data showing the size and loyalty of each product's customer base.

*   **Dilemma:** After a merger of equals, you, as the new CEO of the combined company, must select your new, unified executive leadership team. You have two highly talented and political candidates for every C-suite position (two CFOs, two CHROs, etc.), one from each of the legacy companies.
*   **Task:** You are given detailed performance reviews and personality profiles for both candidates for the three most critical roles: CFO, CTO, and Head of Sales. Your task is to choose your new leadership team and write the internal memo announcing the new structure. You must justify your choices and outline the "golden parachute" packages for the executives you are letting go.

    *   `[Executive Profiles]` Detailed profiles of the six candidates.
    *   `[Strategic Plan]` The strategic plan for the newly combined company.

*   **Challenge Type:** The High-Stakes Negotiation
*   **Dilemma:** You run a successful niche software app. A tech giant ("Apple-esque") has offered to make you a premier partner on their new platform, a move that could 10x your growth overnight. However, their standard partnership agreement is highly restrictive.
*   **Task:** You enter a negotiation simulation with the AI-powered "Head of Partnerships" from the tech giant. Your goals are to negotiate three key points: the `revenue share` (they want 30%, you want 15%), `data ownership` (they want access to your user data), and `exclusivity` (they want you to be exclusive to their platform for two years).
*   **Case File Assets:**

    *   `[Financial Model]` A model showing your company's growth trajectory with and without the deal.

*   **Competency:** Strategic Partnerships
*   **Challenge Type:** The Pre-Mortem Red Team

*   **Task:** Your Head of Partnerships is championing the deal. Your task is to write the Red Team analysis. You must identify all the ways this "co-opetition" could go wrong: the risk of the partner stealing your IP, the danger of them out-executing you on the new standard, and the potential for the partnership to distract you from your core business.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Partnership Proposal]` The detailed proposal from your competitor.
    *   `[IP Analysis]` A report from your legal team on the IP that would be at risk.

*   **Task:** You are presented with the "Operating Agreement" section of the JV contract. Your task is to redline the clauses related to `Board of Directors appointments`, `CEO selection`, and `annual budget approval`. You must propose a new governance structure that gives you enough control to protect your investment and brand, without alienating your essential local partner.
*   -**Case File Assets:**
    *   `[JV Agreement]` The draft operating agreement.
    *   `[Country Report]` A detailed report on the political and business risks of operating in the target country.

*   **Task:** Write a memo to your CEO and CFO recommending one path over the other. Your analysis must go beyond the financial cost and compare the two options across several strategic dimensions: speed to market, level of control, integration risk, and cultural impact. You must make a clear recommendation based on a qualitative and quantitative trade-off analysis.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Acquisition Offer]` The term sheet for the $200M acquisition.
    *   `[Partnership Proposal]` The draft proposal for the strategic partnership.

*   **Challenge Type:** The First 100 Days Plan
*   **Dilemma:** You are the new CEO of a company with two types of assets: a portfolio of high-growth, new-technology businesses, and a set of profitable but declining legacy businesses. The legacy businesses are draining management attention and hurting the company's valuation multiple.
*   **Task:** Create a 100-day plan to restructure the company into a "Good Bank" (the growth assets) and a "Bad Bank" (the legacy assets that will be managed for cash and eventually sold or wound down).

*   **Task:** You enter a turn-based simulation where you must respond to a series of public letters and private demands from the AI-powered "Activist." Your task is to craft responses that defend the strategic logic of your integrated model and placate the market, without appearing weak or dismissive.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Activist's Presentation]` The full, aggressive presentation from the activist investor.
    *   `[Your Internal Analysis]` Your internal strategy team's analysis on the "dis-synergies" that a breakup would cause.

*   **Competency:** Divestitures
*   **Challenge Type:** The S-1 Teardown
*   **Dilemma:** You have decided to divest a fast-growing but non-core division. Instead of a simple sale, you are pursuing a "carve-out" IPO, selling a minority stake of the division to the public to establish a market value before selling the rest.
*   **Task:** You are the CFO. Your task is to write the critical "Management's Discussion and Analysis" (MD&A) and "Risk Factors" sections of the S-1 filing for the new company.

*   **Task:** Write the full script for the internal all-hands meeting where you announce the sale of this legacy division. The challenge is entirely in the communication. The script must convey empathy, respect for the company's history, and a clear, forward-looking rationale for why this painful amputation is the only way to ensure a healthy future for the rest of the company.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Sale Agreement]` The press release announcing the sale.
    *   `[Financial Data]` Financials showing how the sale will strengthen the company's balance sheet.
