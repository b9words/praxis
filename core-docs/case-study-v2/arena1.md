### **Arena 1: The Office - 20 Case Study Blueprints**

#### **Core Competency: Organizational Design**

**1. Title: The "Two-Pizza Team" Re-Org**
*   **Competency:** Organizational Design
*   **Challenge Type:** The First 100 Days Plan
*   **Dilemma:** A successful SaaS company has grown from 200 to 2,000 employees. The once-agile product development process is now bogged down in bureaucracy, with a bloated matrix structure causing endless meetings and slow decisions.
*   **Task:** As the newly hired Chief Product Officer, your mandate is to fix this. Create a detailed 100-day plan to restructure the entire Product & Engineering organization into smaller, autonomous "two-pizza teams." The plan must include the new org chart, a communication plan to manage the anxiety of the change, and a new goal-setting process for the teams.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Org Chart]` The current, complex matrixed organizational chart.
    *   `[Employee Survey]` Anonymous survey results showing deep frustration with "decision speed" and "bureaucracy."
    *   `[Financial Data]` A summary showing slowing product velocity and rising R&D costs per feature shipped.
    *   `[Memo]` A memo from the CEO giving you the authority to "break glass" and fix the problem.

**2. Title: The Integration: Hardware Meets Software**
*   **Competency:** Organizational Design
*   **Challenge Type:** The First 100 Days Plan
*   **Dilemma:** A legacy industrial hardware company ("Siemens-esque") has just acquired a fast-moving, agile AI software startup to build its "next-gen" platform. The two cultures are polar opposites: one is process-driven and hierarchical, the other is flat and chaotic.
*   **Task:** As the newly appointed General Manager of the combined division, create a 100-day integration plan. The key challenge is not financial, but organizational. How do you structure the new division? Do you keep the startup as a separate, protected unit, or do you fully integrate them? The plan must address reporting lines, software development methodologies, and compensation structures.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Org Chart]` Org charts for both the parent company and the acquired startup.
    *   `[Memo]` A memo from the parent company CEO outlining the strategic rationale for the acquisition.
    *   `[Cultural Assessment]` A third-party report detailing the stark cultural differences between the two entities.
    *   `[Financial Data]` The P&L for both the hardware division and the (unprofitable) startup.

**3. Title: The Remote Work Reset**
*   **Competency:** Organizational Design
*   **Challenge Type:** The "Turnaround" Town Hall Script
*   **Dilemma:** After a successful period of mandatory remote work, a company has decided to implement a "hybrid" model. The result is chaos: two distinct cultures are forming, remote employees feel like second-class citizens, and productivity is dropping.
*   **Task:** The CEO has decided to go "remote-first" and is forcing all executives to give up their private offices. Your task is to write the script for the CEO's all-hands meeting announcing this difficult but necessary reset. The script must explain the failures of the hybrid model and lay out the new principles and communication protocols for a successful remote-first culture.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Employee Survey]` Survey data showing a deep divide in satisfaction between remote and in-office employees.
    *   `[Productivity Data]` A report showing a decline in cross-functional project completion rates since the hybrid model was implemented.
    *   `[Memo]` A collection of angry emails from senior managers on both sides of the remote/in-office debate.

**4. Title: The Sales Team Restructure**
*   **Competency:** Organizational Design
*   **Challenge Type:** The Capital Allocation Stack Rank
*   **Dilemma:** A B2B SaaS company is moving upmarket. Its current sales team is structured with "full-stack" account executives who handle everything from prospecting to closing to account management. To win enterprise clients, the Head of Sales believes she needs to specialize the team into distinct roles (SDRs, AEs, Customer Success). This requires a significant budget increase.
*   **Task:** You are the CEO. You are presented with two competing budget proposals for the next fiscal year. **Plan A:** Maintain the current generalist sales structure and hire 20 more AEs. **Plan B:** Use the same budget to hire 10 SDRs, 5 Enterprise AEs, and 5 Customer Success Managers, and invest in new sales technology. Analyze the financial models for each plan and write a memo justifying which organizational structure you will fund.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Financial Model]` Detailed financial models for both Plan A and Plan B, showing headcount costs, quota assumptions, and projected revenue.
    *   `[Market Research]` A report on how successful enterprise SaaS companies structure their sales teams.
    *   `[Sales Data]` Historical sales performance data for the current team, showing long sales cycles for larger deals.

#### **Core Competency: Talent & Performance Management**

**5. Title: The A-Team Budget**
*   **Competency:** Talent & Performance Management
*   **Challenge Type:** The Capital Allocation Stack Rank
*   **Dilemma:** You are the Head of Engineering with a fixed budget for 20 new hires. You have three critical projects, each led by a VP with a different leadership style and a different argument for why their project is the most important.
*   **Task:** Allocate the 20 engineering "headcount slots" across the three projects. You cannot fund them all equally. You must decide whether to give all the resources to the highest-potential project, spread them out to hedge your bets, or allocate them to your best leader. Write a memo to the CEO justifying your allocation, knowing it will create significant political fallout.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Project Briefs]` Detailed, one-page strategic briefs for each of the three projects.
    *   `[Leadership Profiles]` 360-degree feedback summaries for each of the three VPs, detailing their strengths and weaknesses.

**6. Title: The Brilliant Jerk**
*   **Competency:** Talent & Performance Management
*   **Challenge Type:** The First 100 Days Plan
*   **Dilemma:** You have just taken over a new division. Your top performer, the lead architect who is critical to your flagship product, is also a "brilliant jerk." They deliver incredible results but are toxic to the team, creating a culture of fear and causing your best junior talent to quit.
*   **Task:** Create a 100-day plan to resolve this situation. The plan must detail the specific conversations you will have, the performance metrics you will use, and the clear, non-negotiable behavioral changes required. It must also include a contingency plan for what to do if the architect refuses to change, acknowledging the massive short-term risk of firing them.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Performance Data]` Data showing the architect's stellar individual performance.
    *   `[HR Report]` A confidential report from HR detailing multiple complaints and the high attrition rate on the architect's team.
    *   `[Memo]` An email from your predecessor warning you about the situation.

**7. Title: The Compensation Committee**
*   **Competency:** Talent & Performance Management
*   **Challenge Type:** The Board Deck Critique
*   **Dilemma:** Your Head of HR has prepared a presentation for the board's Compensation Committee proposing a new executive bonus structure. The proposal is a standard formula based 80% on revenue growth and 20% on profit. You believe this incentivizes short-term, "growth-at-all-costs" behavior.
*   **Task:** Critique the HR deck. Your comments must propose a more sophisticated bonus structure that incorporates non-financial metrics like customer satisfaction, product quality, and employee retention. You must write a summary email explaining to your HR head why a more balanced set of incentives will create more long-term value.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Presentation Deck]` The draft presentation for the Compensation Committee.
    *   `[Financial Data]` Company financials showing high revenue growth but declining customer satisfaction scores.

**8. Title: The Layoff List**
*   **Competency:** Talent & Performance Management
*   **Challenge Type:** The Capital Allocation Stack Rank
*   **Dilemma:** Due to a market downturn, you have been mandated to cut 15% of your division's headcount. This is not about performance; it is a financial necessity.
*   **Task:** You are given the full roster of your 100-person division, including performance review scores, compensation, and project assignments. Your task is to select the 15 people who will be laid off. You are not just cutting the lowest performers; you must make strategic cuts that preserve the most critical skills for the company's future while causing the least amount of operational disruption. You must produce the final list and a memo to the CEO justifying your painful choices.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Employee Roster]` A detailed spreadsheet of all 100 employees.
    *   `[Strategic Plan]` The company's revised, post-downturn strategic plan highlighting which projects are now top priority.
    *   `[Financial Data]` The budget spreadsheet showing the required salary reduction target.

#### **Core Competency: Operational Excellence**

**9. Title: The "Ship It" Dilemma**
*   **Competency:** Operational Excellence
*   **Challenge Type:** The Pre-Mortem Red Team
*   **Dilemma:** Your company's most important software release in years is scheduled for next week. The Head of Sales is pushing hard to hit the date for the quarterly earnings report. The Head of Engineering has just reported a significant, non-catastrophic bug that will impact 10% of users.
*   **Task:** You are the CEO. Your task is to lead a "Pre-Mortem" analysis. Write a report that outlines all the potential negative second-order consequences of shipping the product *with* the bug (reputational damage, customer support overload, team morale hit) versus the consequences of a costly, last-minute delay (missing the earnings target, losing market momentum). The report must conclude with a clear Go/No-Go recommendation.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Engineering Report]` A technical brief detailing the bug, its impact, and the estimated time to fix it.
    *   `[Marketing Plan]` The full marketing and PR plan for the launch.
    *   `[Email]` A panicked email from the Head of Sales explaining the financial impact of a delay.

**10. Title: The Technical Debt Default**
*   **Competency:** Operational Excellence
*   **Challenge Type:** The Investment Committee Memo
*   **Dilemma:** Your engineering team is spending 50% of its time fixing bugs and managing an unstable, outdated tech stack. The VP of Engineering has proposed a six-month "platform investment" project, where no new features will be shipped, to pay down this "technical debt." The Head of Product argues this will kill the company's growth.
*   **Task:** You are the CTO. Write a memo to the CEO and Head of Product making the case for the six-month development freeze. You must frame technical debt not as an engineering problem, but as a financial liability on the company's balance sheet. Use data to show how the accelerating cost of bug-fixing will soon consume the entire R&D budget if not addressed now.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Engineering Data]` Data showing the rising number of production incidents, bug tickets, and developer time spent on maintenance vs. new features.
    *   `[Product Roadmap]` The ambitious product roadmap that will be put on hold.
    *   `[Financial Data]` The company's P&L, showing the R&D budget.

**11. Title: The OKR Cascade**
*   **Competency:** Operational Excellence
*   **Challenge Type:** The Board Deck Critique
*   **Dilemma:** Your company has implemented the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) system, but it's not working. The goals are misaligned, and teams are working at cross-purposes. The leadership team has prepared a deck for the next all-hands meeting to present the OKRs for the upcoming quarter.
*   **Task:** Critique the OKR deck. The deck is a list of departmental goals. Your task is to leave comments that force the team to rewrite the OKRs to be truly interconnected and aligned with the single, top-level company objective. You must identify where different departmental Key Results are in conflict with each other.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Presentation Deck]` The draft OKR presentation.
    *   `[Memo]` The CEO's memo outlining the #1 strategic priority for the year.
    *   `[Employee Survey]` Survey results showing confusion about company priorities.

**12. Title: The Pricing Model Overhaul**
*   **Competency:** Operational Excellence
*   **Challenge Type:** The Capital Allocation Stack Rank
*   **Dilemma:** A successful B2B SaaS company has a simple, one-size-fits-all pricing model. As they move upmarket, the Head of Product believes they need to move to a more complex, feature-based, three-tiered pricing model ("Good, Better, Best"). The Head of Sales argues this will create friction and slow down the sales cycle.
*   **Task:** You are presented with two detailed proposals. **Proposal A:** Keep the simple pricing and invest in marketing to drive more volume. **Proposal B:** Invest heavily in a "pricing overhaul" project, which will require significant engineering and marketing resources but could increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). Analyze the financial models for both and write a memo justifying your decision.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Financial Model]` Models projecting the revenue and costs for both pricing strategies.
    *   `[Market Research]` A report on how competitors price their products.
    *   `[Customer Interviews]` Transcripts of interviews with both small business customers (who love the simple price) and enterprise customers (who want more features and are willing to pay more).

#### **Core Competency: Leading a Turnaround**

**13. Title: The Legacy Turnaround**
*   **Competency:** Leading a Turnaround
*   **Challenge Type:** The "Turnaround" Town Hall Script
*   **Dilemma:** You have been hired as the new CEO of a 100-year-old, beloved consumer brand that is now near bankruptcy. The company is filled with loyal, long-serving employees but has failed to innovate. You have 90 days to implement a painful but necessary turnaround plan.
*   **Task:** Write the full script for your first all-hands meeting. The challenge is to strike an incredibly difficult balance: honoring the company's proud history and respecting the employees' loyalty, while simultaneously delivering the brutal news about the layoffs and strategic shifts required for survival.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Financial Data]` The company's dire financial statements.
    *   `[Turnaround Plan]` The high-level turnaround plan approved by the board.
    *   `[Employee Survey]` Survey data showing deep employee loyalty but also high resistance to change.

**14. Title: The "Cash is King" Mandate**
*   **Competency:** Leading a Turnaround
*   **Challenge Type:** The First 100 Days Plan
*   **Dilemma:** You are the new CEO of a high-growth tech startup that has just had its funding pulled due to a market crash. The company has six months of cash runway left. The previous culture was focused on growth-at-all-costs. You must now pivot the entire company to a culture of immediate profitability and cash preservation.
*   **Task:** Create a 100-day plan that is ruthlessly focused on extending the company's cash runway. The plan must detail immediate budget cuts, a hiring freeze, changes to sales compensation to prioritize cash-upfront deals, and a renegotiation of supplier payment terms.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Financial Data]` The company's cash flow statement and burn rate analysis.
    *   `[Sales Pipeline]` The current sales pipeline data.
    *   `[Memo]` A memo from the board giving you the mandate to do "whatever it takes" to get to cash-flow positive.

**15. Title: The Post-Acquisition Failure**
*   **Competency:** Leading a Turnaround
*   **Challenge Type:** The Forensic Audit
*   **Dilemma:** Two years ago, your company made a large, celebrated acquisition. It has been a complete failure. The acquired technology was never successfully integrated, key talent has left, and the division is now losing millions. The board has fired the previous CEO and hired you to fix it.
*   **Task:** You are the new CEO. Your task is to conduct a forensic audit of the original deal. You are given access to the original due diligence documents, the integration plan, and internal emails from the past two years. Your goal is to produce a report for the board that identifies the root causes of the failure. Was it a bad strategy, flawed due to diligence, or a failure of post-merger integration?

**16. Title: The Founder's Mess**
*   **Competency:** Leading a Turnaround
*   **Challenge Type:** The Board Deck Critique
*   **Dilemma:** You are a professional CEO brought in to run a company where the brilliant but chaotic founder has just been moved to the Chairman role. The founder has left behind a portfolio of a dozen experimental "moonshot" projects, which are draining the resources of the profitable core business.
*   **Task:** The management team has prepared a deck for your first board meeting that timidly proposes continuing to fund all of the founder's projects. Your task is to critique this deck. You must leave comments that force the team to apply a rigorous financial and strategic filter, recommending that at least half of the moonshot projects be shut down immediately so you can reinvest in the core business.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Presentation Deck]` The draft board presentation.
    *   `[Financial Data]` Financials showing the profitability of the core business and the massive losses from the moonshot projects.

**17. Title: The "Kill the Brand" Decision**
*   **Competency:** Leading a Turnaround
*   **Challenge Type:** The Investment Committee Memo
*   **Dilemma:** You are the CEO of a consumer goods company with a portfolio of brands. One of your oldest brands is slowly declining but still profitable and has a small, intensely loyal customer base. Your marketing team argues that any further investment in this brand is a waste of money that should be reallocated to your high-growth brands.
*   **Task:** Write a memo to your leadership team making the final decision. You must choose between two paths: 1) Proactively "kill" the legacy brand and absorb its customers into your other brands. 2) Keep the brand alive with a minimal "maintenance" budget, preserving its cash flow but forgoing any growth. You must analyze the financial and brand equity implications of each choice.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Financial Data]` P&L statements for all brands in the portfolio.
    *   `[Market Research]` Data showing the declining market share but high customer loyalty of the legacy brand.
    *   `[Marketing Proposals]` Budget proposals from the different brand managers.

**18. Title: The Union Showdown**
*   **Competency:** Leading a Turnaround
*   **Challenge Type:** The Redline Negotiation
*   **Dilemma:** You are the CEO of an old-line manufacturing company that is on the verge of bankruptcy. To survive, you must secure significant wage and benefits concessions from your powerful labor union. The union is deeply skeptical and is threatening a crippling strike.
*   **Task:** You are presented with the union's initial proposal for the new collective bargaining agreement. Your task is to redline the key clauses related to wages, healthcare costs, and work rules. You must write a justification for your counter-proposal that is both financially sound for the company and politically palatable enough for the union leadership to sell to its members.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Union Proposal]` The union's proposed contract.
    *   `[Financial Data]` The company's financial statements showing its precarious cash position.

**19. Title: The "Sacred Cow" Project**
*   **Competency:** Leading a Turnaround
*   **Challenge Type:** The Pre-Mortem Red Team
*   **Dilemma:** In a turnaround situation, you have identified that a major R&D project, which was the personal passion project of the former CEO and is beloved by the engineering team, has no viable path to commercialization and is draining millions in cash.
*   **Task:** You must kill the project. Your task is to write a Red Team analysis that serves as the basis for your decision. The report must respectfully acknowledge the project's technical achievements while ruthlessly detailing its commercial and strategic flaws. The goal is to create an undeniable, data-driven case that makes the difficult decision to kill the "sacred cow" seem rational and unavoidable.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Project Brief]` The original, optimistic project brief for the R&D project.
    *   `[Financial Data]` Data showing the project's massive budget overruns.
    *   `[Market Research]` A recent report showing that the market window for this technology has likely closed.

**20. Title: The New Narrative**
*   **Competency:** Leading a Turnaround
*   **Challenge Type:** The Public Shareholder Letter
*   **Dilemma:** After a brutal 18-month turnaround involving layoffs, divestitures, and restructuring, the company is finally financially stable but its growth prospects are unclear and employee morale is shattered.
*   **Task:** You are the CEO. Your task is to write the opening section of the annual shareholder letter. This is the most important communication of your tenure. You must pivot the narrative away from "survival" and towards a new, credible, and inspiring vision for the company's future growth. The letter must acknowledge the pain of the past while confidently charting a course for the future.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Financial Data]` Financials showing the stabilized (but not growing) company.
    *   `[Press Clippings]` A collection of negative press articles from the past 18 months.
    *   `[Strategic Plan]` The high-level summary of your new growth strategy.
