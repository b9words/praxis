### **Arena 3: The Board Room - 20 Case Study Blueprints**

#### **Core Competency: Capital Allocation Strategy**

**1. Title: The "Bet the Company" Moonshot**
*   **Competency:** Capital Allocation Strategy
*   **Challenge Type:** The Investment Committee Memo
*   **Dilemma:** Your R&D division, led by a brilliant but notoriously difficult visionary, has proposed a "moonshot" project. It requires a massive, multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment that will crush short-term profits. If successful, it could redefine the company and the entire industry. If it fails, it could bankrupt the company.
*   **Task:** You are the CEO. You have decided to back the project. Your task is to write the definitive memo to your skeptical, financially-minded board. You must make a compelling, rational case for a seemingly irrational bet, framing it as a calculated risk necessary for long-term survival and dominance.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Project Brief]` The visionary's ambitious, technically-dense proposal.
    *   `[Financial Model]` A financial model showing the massive upfront losses and the wildly uncertain, but potentially enormous, future payoff.
    *   `[Risk Assessment]` A third-party consultant's report highlighting the project's low probability of success.
    *   `[Board Profiles]` Profiles of your key board members, including a risk-averse former CFO and a growth-focused venture capitalist.

**2. Title: The Dividend vs. Buyback Debate**
*   **Competency:** Capital Allocation Strategy
*   **Challenge Type:** The Board Deck Critique
*   **Dilemma:** Your mature, cash-generative company is sitting on a large pile of cash. Your CFO has prepared a presentation for the board proposing the initiation of a quarterly dividend. You, the CEO, believe a flexible share buyback program is a far superior tool for returning capital.
*   **Task:** Critique the CFO's board deck. Your comments must systematically dismantle the case for a dividend (highlighting its inflexibility and tax inefficiency) and insert new slides that make a powerful, data-driven argument for a share buyback program, emphasizing its ability to create value when the stock is undervalued.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Presentation Deck]` The CFO's draft "Initiate a Dividend" presentation.
    *   `[Financial Data]` The company's financials and historical stock price chart.
    *   `[Analyst Reports]` A collection of analyst reports, some calling for a dividend, others for buybacks.

**3. Title: The Activist's Ultimatum**
*   **Competency:** Capital Allocation Strategy
*   **Challenge Type:** The Emergency Board Communication

*   **Task:** You have 24 hours to prepare the urgent, confidential briefing for your Board of Directors. The document must summarize the activist's demands, provide a clear-eyed assessment of the activist's chances of success in a proxy fight, and outline your recommended response strategy (Negotiate? Fight? Capitulate?).
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Activist's Letter]` The aggressive, confidential letter from the activist investor.
    *   `[Shareholder Analysis]` A report from your investor relations team analyzing your current shareholder base and their likely allegiance in a proxy fight.

**4. Title: The "Harvest or Invest" Decision**
*   **Competency:** Capital Allocation Strategy
*   **Challenge Type:** The Capital Allocation Stack Rank
*   **Dilemma:** You are the CEO of a conglomerate. Your legacy "cash cow" division is profitable but in a structurally declining market. The division's manager is lobbying for a significant capital investment to "reinvigorate" the brand. Your CFO argues the division should be put into "harvest mode," with its cash flows reallocated to your high-growth digital division.
*   **Task:** You are presented with two detailed, five-year strategic plans and financial models. **Plan A:** The "Reinvigorate" plan, showing a large upfront investment with a modest, uncertain return. **Plan B:** The "Harvest" plan, showing declining revenue but massive free cash flow. You must choose one and write the memo to the board justifying your decision.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Strategic Plans]` The two competing strategic and financial plans.
    *   `[Market Data]` A market research report confirming the long-term decline of the legacy market.

*   **Task:** Your task is to critique the deck. You are not correcting typos; you are acting as a story editor. You must leave high-level comments that force the team to completely restructure the presentation, starting with a powerful "why," building a clear narrative, and ending with a decisive call to action.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Presentation Deck]` The long, unfocused draft board presentation.
    *   `[Financial Model]` The complex financial model behind the pivot.

*   **Task:** Write the confidential, one-page briefing memo that will be sent to the board the night before the meeting.

*   **Task:** You enter a one-on-one, turn-based negotiation simulation with the AI-powered "Leaking Director." Your goal is not to accuse them directly, but to use a series of carefully worded questions and statements to get them to implicitly acknowledge their behavior and agree to a new code of conduct, all without causing them to resign and create a public governance crisis.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[News Article]` The damaging news article with the leaked information.
    *   `[Board Minutes]` The minutes from the confidential board meeting.

*   **Task:** You must present and defend your proposed compensation plan to the AI-powered "Compensation Committee." The committee, led by the skeptical director, will aggressively question the justification for your pay, comparing it to the median employee salary and the company's recent stock performance. Your task is to make a rational, data-driven case without appearing greedy or out of touch.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Compensation Proposal]` The full details of your proposed salary, bonus, and equity package.
    *   `[Benchmarking Data]` A consultant's report showing comparable CEO pay at peer companies.

*   **Task:** You are the CEO. You must make the final "Go/No-Go" decision on the recall. The task is to write the formal decision memo for the board. The memo must weigh the quantifiable financial cost of the recall against the unquantifiable, but potentially catastrophic, risk of inaction.
*   **Case File Assets:**

    *   `[Legal Memo]` A memo from your General Counsel outlining the legal liability and potential damages.

*   **Task:** You are the General Counsel. Your CEO wants to fight. Your task is to redline the proposed settlement agreement. You will negotiate not the price, but the non-financial terms: the scope of the public admission of guilt, the cross-licensing of patents, and the agreement not to sue in the future. The goal is to make the settlement as strategically palatable as possible.
*   **Case File Assets:**
    *   `[Settlement Agreement]` The draft settlement agreement from the plaintiff.
