### **The Praxis Program: Case Study Taxonomy**

This taxonomy is organized into three hierarchical levels:
1.  **The Five Arenas of Executive Action:** The high-level context where a leader operates.
2.  **The Core Competencies:** The specific, high-level skills required to win in each Arena.
3.  **The Skill-Forging Challenges:** The specific, tangible case study types designed to build each competency.
