### **Part 2: Pre-Launch Polish & Final Checks**

These are the final tasks that ensure a smooth launch and a professional user experience from day one.

| Category | Task | Why It's Critical | Action Plan (Without Over-engineering) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Experience** | **Custom Error Pages** | A generic "404 Not Found" or "500 Server Error" page breaks the brand experience and feels unprofessional. | **1. Create `app/not-found.tsx`:** Design a custom 404 page that aligns with your brand. Use the "Analyst" voice. *UX Writing:* `"Error 404: The requested asset could not be located. Double-check your coordinates or return to the main dashboard."`<br>**2. Create `app/error.tsx`:** Create a global error boundary for unexpected server-side errors. This page should be simple, reassuring, and provide a way for the user to report the issue (e.g., a "Contact Support" button with your `mailto:` link). |
| | **Loading States** | Pages that are slow to load data should show a "skeleton" UI instead of a blank white screen. This improves perceived performance. | You have already implemented `loading.tsx` files throughout your app, which is excellent. **Action:** Do a final review of every page that fetches data (`dashboard`, `library`, `profile`, `debrief`) and ensure the skeleton loader accurately reflects the final layout. This prevents jarring content shifts. |
| **Legal & Trust**| **Transactional Email Footers** | All automated emails (welcome, receipts, notifications) must comply with anti-spam laws like CAN-SPAM. | **1. Unsubscribe Link:** Every non-essential email (like a weekly summary) must have a clear unsubscribe link in the footer. This link should go to a page where the user can manage their notification preferences (`/profile/settings/notifications`).<br>**2. Physical Address:** Your company's physical mailing address must be included in the footer of all marketing and transactional emails. |
| **Business Operations** | **Payment Failure & Dunning** | What happens when a user's credit card fails for their monthly subscription renewal? If you do nothing, you will lose revenue. | **1. Configure Paddle's Dunning:** This is a built-in feature of your payment provider. In your Paddle dashboard, configure the "Subscription Retries" or "Dunning" settings. A standard setup is to automatically retry the payment 3-4 times over a week and send automated emails to the user asking them to update their payment information.<br>**2. Handle the `subscription.past_due` Webhook:** In your `webhooks/paddle/route.ts`, add logic to handle this event. When a subscription becomes past due, update the user's status in your database. This allows you to show a "Your Subscription is Past Due" banner inside the app. |
| **Marketing & Launch** | **Set Up Production Analytics** | Your analytics tools need to be configured for your production domain. | **1. Configure PostHog for Production:** In your PostHog project settings, add your production domain (`www.praxisprogram.com`) to the list of authorized domains.<br>**2. Set Up a Funnel:** In PostHog, create a simple conversion funnel to track your most critical user flow: `Viewed Pricing Page -> Clicked Subscribe -> Completed Signup -> Completed Onboarding`. This is your most important business metric. |
