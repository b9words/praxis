This revised document incorporates the strategic analysis to transform the original feature checklist into a cohesive, value-driven, and sticky end-to-end user flow. It is architected around a clear "golden path" that guides the user from commitment to consumption, application, and signaling.

The changes are designed to reduce friction, increase engagement, and align every feature with the core goal: **building a sticky, value-adding platform for aspiring future CEOs that balances consumption (Lessons) and activity (Case Studies).**

### **Execemy UX Plan V2.1: The Guided Journey**

This document validates the "desktop-first, user-centric" UX improvements end-to-end, with a focus on creating a cohesive and guided user journey. Desktop viewport (~1280px+).

## **0) Onboarding & Commitment Ritual**
*   **Goal:** To establish the platform's value, secure user commitment, and provide an immediate, clear path to progress.

- **Pre-flight:** Sign in with a brand new test user.
- Go to `/onboarding`.
- **Step 1: Welcome & Value Proposition:**
  - Validate a clear, concise screen that frames the platform not as a "course," but as a "proving ground for future leaders."
- **Step 2: The Commitment Ritual:**
  - **New:** Validate an interactive "Weekly Commitment" screen. A slider or set of buttons allows the user to select a weekly time goal (e.g., 1 to 10 hours). This is a mandatory, active choice, not a bio field.
  - The selected goal (`targetHours`) is saved to the user's profile.
- **Step 3: The "Learning Track" Selection:**
  - **New:** Validate a screen asking the user to select their primary goal (e.g., "Prepare for Management," "Master Corporate Strategy," "Think Like an Investor").
  - Selecting a track saves their choice and pre-populates their first curated sequence of lessons and cases.
- **Step 4: Final Profile Setup:**
  - User sets their display name, @username, and avatar.
- **Analytics:** Completing each step sends an `onboarding_step_completed` event with `{stepNumber, stepName, selectedGoalHours, selectedTrack}`.

## **1) Dashboard: Your Mission Control**
*   **Goal:** To provide a clear, dynamic view of the user's progress and their single most important next step. It should feel like a GPS, not a rear-view mirror.

- Open `/dashboard`.
- **Validate "Your Next Step" (Primary Component):**
  - **New:** A single, prominent component has replaced "Continue Learning" and "Recommended Next." It is titled "Your Next Step on the '[Track Name]' Track".
  - It shows the current in-progress or next-up item (Lesson or Case Study) with a clear CTA.
  - It may also show the next 1-2 items in the sequence in a faded or smaller state to build anticipation.
- **Validate Weekly Goal Card:**
  - Card shows: `currentHours / targetHours`. The bar width reflects progress%.
  - If no goal was set in onboarding, it defaults to 2 hours and includes a CTA to "Set Your Weekly Goal."
- **Validate "Momentum" Card:**
  - **New:** The "Streak" card is rebranded as "Momentum."
  - It shows the current streak (e.g., "3-day momentum") and may include a small sparkline chart visualizing activity over the last 7 days.
- **Validate "Key Insights" Card (Conditional):**
  - **New:** If the user has completed at least one case study, this card appears.
  - It displays one of the user's "Unlocked Insights" from a previous debrief, rotating periodically. This reinforces past learning.
- **Edge Case (0 Progress):**
  - For a new user, "Your Next Step" shows the very first item in their chosen Learning Track. "Momentum" is hidden or shows 0. "Key Insights" is hidden.

## **2) Lesson Reader: Consumption to Application**
*   **Goal:** To create an optimal reading experience that constantly bridges the gap between theory and practice.

- Open any lesson at `/library/curriculum/[domain]/[module]/[lesson]`.
- **Validate Layout:**
  - Header shows read time and a 1px full-width progress bar.
  - Two-column layout: primary content left, right rail with sticky elements.
- **Validate Right Rail:**
  - Top: **New "Key Takeaways" section.** As the user scrolls past H2/H3 headers, key concepts are added to this running summary.
  - Bottom: Sticky Table of Contents (TOC) with active section highlighting.
- **Validate Inline Engagement:**
  - **New "Apply This Now" Blocks:** At a key point where a framework (e.g., SWOT) is introduced, validate an inline block appears with a CTA: "Ready to apply this? Jump into the '[Case Study Name]' Case Study."
  - Inline multiple-choice checks function as before.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** "n" for next, "p" for previous, "?" for help.

## **3) Case Study Workspace: The IDE for Business**
*   **Goal:** To provide a focused, powerful, and cognitively efficient environment for deep work.

- Open a case at `/library/case-studies/[caseId]`.
- **Validate New Two-Panel Layout:**
  - **New:** The layout is a resizable two-panel view.
  - **Left Panel (Context Panel):** Contains a tabbed interface at the top.
    - Validate tabs: "Tasks," "Case Files," "Rubric."
    - "Tasks" shows the stepper for the challenge stages.
    - "Case Files" shows the file explorer for all reference documents.
    - "Rubric" shows the scoring guide for the current task.
  - **Right Panel (Workspace Panel):** This is the main, larger panel.
    - It contains the active challenge component (memo editor, financial model, etc.).
    - The prompt for the current task is displayed clearly at the top.
- **Validate Autosave:**
  - Typing in an input shows "Saving..." and then "Last saved..." status.
- **Validate Actions:**
  - Submit & Continue advances the stepper in the left panel and loads the next challenge component in the right panel.

## **4) Debrief & Community Hub**
*   **Goal:** To deliver a powerful debrief experience and elevate community content into a core learning asset.

- Complete a case study. The user is navigated to `/debriefs/[caseId]/[submissionId]`.
- **Validate Debrief UX:**
  - The "Performance Scorecard," "AI Coach's Analysis," and "Gold Standard" sections are present and clear.
- **Validate "Forward Path":**
  - **New:** At the end of the personal debrief, validate the **"Skill Unlocked"** pop-up appears with a concise, memorable insight.
  - **New:** Below the pop-up, validate the **"Choose Your Next Challenge"** component appears, offering two curated next steps: "Shore Up a Weakness" and "Build on a Strength."
- **Validate Community Integration:**
  - **New:** From the debrief page, there is a prominent tab or CTA to "View Community Debriefs."
  - Clicking this navigates to a dedicated page for that case, featuring the "Top," "New," and "Following" sorted community responses. This is the new Community Hub.

## **5) Public Profiles: Signaling Competence**
*   **Goal:** To transform the profile from a list of stats into a credible, skills-based signal of the user's competence.

- Visit `/u/[username]`.
- **Validate "Praxis Radar Chart":**
  - **New:** The most prominent "hero" element on the page is the visual radar chart of the user's validated competencies (Strategic Thinking, Financial Acumen, etc.).
- **Validate "Showcased Debriefs":**
  - **New:** Below the radar chart is a section for "Showcased Debriefs."
  - It automatically displays the user's top 3 highest-rated or most-liked case study responses, including their score and a snippet of their work.
- Standard info (name, stats, etc.) is still present but secondary to the new showcase elements.
- Private profiles return a 404.

## **6) Library Information Architecture (IA)**
*   **Goal:** To provide a clear, intuitive way for users to both follow their guided path and explore content freely.

- Open `/library`.
- **Validate Tabs:**
  - **New "My Track" Tab:** This is the new default tab. It shows the user's currently active Learning Track and their progress.
  - **"Browse" Tab:** Contains sub-tabs for "Articles" and "Case Studies" for free exploration.
  - **New "Debriefs" Tab:** A dedicated area to browse the most insightful community responses from popular case studies.
  - **"Saved" Tab:** For content the user has bookmarked.
- Validate contextual Empty States for each section.

    - 50% → 'lesson_progress' event with {progressPercentage: 50}
    - 100% or status=completed → event with {progressPercentage: 100}
- **Onboarding:**
  - Go through `/onboarding`. Completing each step sends 'onboarding_step_completed' with {stepNumber, stepName, selectedGoalHours, selectedTrack}.
- **Case decision:**
  - Submitting a decision sends 'case_decision_submitted' with {decisionPointId, decisionIndex, hasPersonaChat}.
- **Response liked:**
  - Toggling like sends 'response_liked' with {responseId, caseId, liked, userId}.
- **Apply This Now clicked:**
  - Clicking an "Apply This Now" CTA in a lesson sends 'apply_this_now_clicked' with {caseId, caseTitle}.

### **8) Notifications**
- As User A, post a public response on a case.
- As User B, like User A's response.
- Switch to User A:
  - Bell icon appears in Navbar if there are notifications.
  - Open bell menu; verify a notification "Someone liked your response" with a link to the correct case page.
  - Click "Mark all read" clears unread badges.
- Link correctness:
  - The link must be to `/library/case-studies/[caseId]` and open the case.

### **9) Accessibility + Desktop-first polish**
- Check tab navigation order and focus ring on interactive elements in:
  - Lesson reader (buttons, TOC links)
  - Dashboard cards
  - Case workspace buttons
  - Library tabs
- Verify headings are logical (H1/H2/H3) and landmarks are consistent.

### **10) Error/Loading/Empty States**
- Temporarily simulate network errors (e.g., throttle or fail API):
  - Loading states show lightweight skeleton/spinners (no layout shift).
  - Error states show clear retry or informative text.
  - Empty states offer next-step CTAs.

### **11) Edge Cases**
- Dashboard when user has 0 progress:
  - Weekly Goal defaults to 2h; 0 current hours; Momentum hidden or 0.
  - "Your Next Step" shows the very first item in their chosen Learning Track.
- Weekly Goal parsing:
  - Primary source is `profiles.weekly_target_hours` (structured field).
  - Fallback: Parse bio variations like "Weekly commitment: 3 hours" (case-insensitive and robust).
  - Final fallback: Default to 2 hours.
- Notifications:
  - If no notifications exist, bell hides; once notifications exist, it appears.
