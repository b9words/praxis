## Recommendation

The Strategic Planning Team recommends **Option 3: Full Direct-to-Consumer Platform** with the following rationale:

1. **Market Timing:** Window for successful entry closing rapidly

**Critical Success Requirements:**
- Minimum $2B investment commitment

- 60M subscriber target by Year 3
- $6.99 launch price point

The cost of inaction exceeds the risk of execution failure. Disney must move aggressively to secure its position in the streaming future.
