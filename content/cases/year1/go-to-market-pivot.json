    "situation": "SecureCloud is a 2-year-old cybersecurity SaaS platform focused on cloud infrastructure security. The product has strong technical differentiation and happy customers, but sales are inefficient and unpredictable. You joined as VP of Sales 4 months ago after the previous VP left.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- ARR: $8M (grew from $2M last year)\n- 85 customers (average ACV: $94,000)\n- Sales team: 8 AEs, 5 SDRs, no sales engineers\n- Sales cycle: 6-9 months (longer than competitors)\n- Win rate: 12% of qualified opportunities\n- CAC: $140,000 (unsustainable)\n- Pipeline generation is inconsistent\n- AEs are overwhelmed with technical questions\n- No clear ICP or sales playbook\n\n**The Problem:**\nThe CEO acknowledges the GTM motion is broken but isn't sure why. Recent analysis reveals:\n- Deals come from 3 distinct buyer personas with different needs\n- Technical evaluation takes 50% of sales cycle (competitors bypass this)\n- No clear path to $50M ARR with current approach\n- Best AE closed $2M, worst closed $200K (10x variance)\n- Marketing generates leads, but quality is inconsistent\n- Partners keep asking about referral programs (no formal program exists)\n\nBoard pressure is mounting to \"fix sales\" before next funding round.",
