    "situation": "CloudScale is a B2B SaaS platform helping mid-market companies manage their cloud infrastructure. You joined as COO 3 months ago. The company just closed a Series B ($30M) and is growing revenue 15% month-over-month. However, the CFO just flagged concerning unit economics in the latest board materials.\n\nThe CEO (Sarah Chen) has called an urgent meeting. She's asking you to lead the analysis and present recommendations at next week's board meeting.\n\n**Key Context:**\n- Founded 3 years ago\n- Current ARR: $12M (growing from $5M last year)\n- 450 customers (up from 200 last year)\n- Team size: 85 people (was 45 last year)\n- Burn rate: $2.5M/month (runway: 18 months post-Series B)\n- Average contract value: $26,700 annual\n- Customer acquisition cost (CAC): $32,000\n- Lifetime value (LTV): $78,000\n\n**The Problem:**\nWhile top-line growth looks impressive, the CFO's analysis shows:\n- LTV:CAC ratio has dropped from 3.5:1 to 2.4:1 in 6 months\n- CAC payback period increased from 14 months to 22 months\n- Gross margin declined from 78% to 71%\n- Net dollar retention slipped from 118% to 105%",
