## Case Brief

### Company Overview

**BrightHome Furniture**
- **Industry**: Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Furniture & Home Goods
- **Founded**: 2019
- **Stage**: Series B ($25M raised, profitable)
- **Location**: Los Angeles, CA
- **Team Size**: 120 employees

**Your Role**: VP of Operations (reporting to CEO)

### The Situation

BrightHome has been a success story—profitable DTC furniture company with $40M ARR, 35% gross margins, and strong brand. The company manufactures 70% of products in Vietnam, 20% in China, and 10% domestically (US).

**The Crisis (October 2023):**

Three simultaneous supply chain shocks have hit the company:

1. **Vietnam Factory Fire**: Your largest manufacturing partner (50% of production) had a fire. Factory offline for 4-6 months. No casualties, but facility destroyed.

2. **Port Congestion**: LA/Long Beach ports experiencing severe congestion (35-day average wait times vs. normal 5-7 days). Containers stuck at sea.

3. **Shipping Cost Spike**: Container rates from Asia to US West Coast jumped from $3,000 to $12,000 (4x increase) due to port congestion + demand surge.

**Immediate Impact:**
```
Current Inventory: 8 weeks on hand (normally 12 weeks)
Inbound Shipments Delayed: 15 containers stuck at port (worth $2.5M)
Q4 Holiday Orders: $18M in pre-orders (deliver by Nov 15)
Stock-Out Risk: 60% of SKUs will be out of stock by Nov 1
Customer Cancellation Right: Full refund if not delivered by Nov 20
```

**CEO's Email (This Morning):**
```
Subject: URGENT - Supply Chain Crisis War Room

Team,

We're facing an existential threat. If we can't fulfill Q4 holiday orders:
  - $18M revenue at risk (45% of annual revenue!)
  - Customer trust destroyed (we've never missed deadlines)
  - Potential bankruptcy if refunds exceed cash on hand

I need options on my desk by EOD. All options are on the table:
  - Air freight (expensive but fast)
  - Alternative suppliers (quality risk)
  - Customer communication (delay orders?)
  - Product substitution (different SKUs?)

This is an all-hands-on-deck crisis. I trust you to lead us through this.

- Maria (CEO)
```

### Current State Metrics

    ✅ Converts at-risk orders to fulfilled orders
    ✅ Clears excess inventory (storage items overstocked)
    ✅ Customer gets product on time (satisfaction)
  
  Cons:
    ❌ Product may not match customer's aesthetic/needs
    ❌ May not have suitable substitutes for all SKUs
    ❌ Margin hit (discount required to incentivize)
```

### File 4: Financial Scenario Modeling

Baseline Scenario (Do Nothing, Let Chips Fall):
  Inventory Runs Out: Nov 1 (60% of SKUs)
  Orders Fulfilled: 40% ($7.2M)
  Orders Cancelled: 60% ($10.8M refunds)

### File 5: Long-Term Supply Chain Redesign

```
Post-Crisis Strategic Questions:

Question 1: Should we diversify geographically?
  Current: 70% Vietnam, 20% China, 10% US
  Proposed: 40% Vietnam, 20% China, 20% Mexico, 20% US
  
  Pros:
    ✅ Risk mitigation (no single point of failure)
    ✅ Nearshoring (Mexico) = faster, more flexible
    ✅ Reshoring (US) = premium option, no tariffs
  
  Cons:
    ❌ Higher costs (Mexico/US 38-75% more expensive)
    ❌ Complexity (managing 4 regions vs. 2)
    ❌ Quality consistency (more suppliers = more variability)

Question 2: Should we increase inventory levels?
  Current: 12 weeks target (8 weeks actual after crisis)
  Proposed: 16-20 weeks (safety stock for disruptions)
  
  Pros:
    ✅ Buffer against disruptions
    ✅ Faster fulfillment (ship from warehouse, not factory)
  
  Cons:
    ❌ Cash tied up in inventory ($4M additional)
    ❌ Storage costs (+$200K/year)
    ❌ Obsolescence risk (styles change)

Question 3: Should we own manufacturing?
  Current: Contract manufacturers (asset-light)
  Proposed: Acquire factory or build our own
  
  Pros:
    ✅ Control (no surprises like fire)
    ✅ Quality (directly managed)
    ✅ Margins (eliminate supplier markup)
  
  Cons:
    ❌ Capital intensive ($10-20M to build/acquire)
    ❌ Complexity (not our core competency)
    ❌ Fixed costs (must run factory at capacity)

Question 4: Should we change business model?
  Current: Pre-orders (customers order, we ship in 4-8 weeks)
  Proposed: Made-to-stock (stock everything, ship in 2 days)
  
  Pros:
    ✅ Faster fulfillment (compete with Amazon)
    ✅ Less disruption impact (buffer inventory)
  
  Cons:
    ❌ Massive inventory investment ($8-10M)
    ❌ Demand forecasting risk (wrong SKUs stocked)
    ❌ Complexity (120 SKUs x 16 weeks = $12M inventory)
```

## AI Coach Prompts

**Persona: David Park, Former VP Operations at Wayfair**

**Coaching Style**: Tactical, detail-oriented, expects quantitative analysis

**Sample Dialogue:**

Student: "I'd use air freight to solve the problem."

David: "Air freight for what? All 3,200 orders? That's physically impossible. Air charter capacity is 500 units/week. Even if you maxed out air freight for 4 weeks, that's only 2,000 units. And 30% of your products are too large for air. Show me the math. Which specific SKUs are you air freighting? How many units? What's the cost?"

Student: "I'd air freight chairs and small items, ocean freight large items."

David: "Better. Now quantify it. Chairs are 600 units at risk. If you air freight all 600 chairs over 2 weeks (300/week), that's $320 x 600 = $192K. What about dining tables? 900 units, can't air freight those. They're in Vietnam, factory's gone. Where are you getting 900 dining tables in the next 30 days? Show me your supplier plan."

**Debrief Focus Areas:**
1. Did the student create a realistic supplier allocation plan?
2. Did they calculate actual logistics costs and compare options?
3. Did they prioritize SKUs based on clear criteria (revenue? margin? risk?)?
4. Did they balance short-term survival with long-term customer trust?
5. Did they create a phased supply chain redesign (not just vague platitudes)?

## Expected Insights

Strong students will recognize:

1. **This is a multi-dimensional crisis requiring simultaneous action**
   - Can't just "use air freight" (not enough capacity, some products too large)
   - Can't just "find new suppliers" (takes weeks to onboard, quality risk)
   - Need a combination: existing suppliers + new suppliers + logistics optimization + customer communication

2. **Financial constraints are real**
   - Only $8M cash, $18M at risk
   - If 50%+ customers cancel, company goes bankrupt
   - Must balance "spend money to fulfill orders" vs. "preserve cash to survive"

3. **Not all customers and products are equal**
   - VIP customers (10% of orders) = disproportionate long-term value
   - Hero products (sofas) = brand identity
   - First-time customers = future LTV at stake
   - Need explicit prioritization framework

4. **Customer communication is a strategic decision**
   - Proactive transparency = trust but may trigger cancellations
   - Silence = short-term revenue protection but long-term brand damage
   - No perfect answer, but must choose deliberately (not default)

5. **This crisis is a forcing function for long-term supply chain redesign**
   - Over-reliance on single country (Vietnam 70%) = fragile
   - Nearshoring (Mexico) and reshoring (US) cost more but provide speed and resilience
   - Inventory levels were too lean (just-in-time broke during COVID and now)
   - Must rebalance: cost efficiency vs. supply chain resilience

**The Winning Strategy**: 
1. **Immediate (Week 1)**: Activate ChinaCo (existing), MexicoCo (fast), USCo (premium) to diversify supply
2. **Logistics (Week 1-4)**: Hybrid approach (air freight small items, expedited ocean for large items)
3. **Communication (Week 1)**: Segment customers (VIPs personal outreach, others transparent email with realistic timelines)
4. **Long-term (Q1 next year)**: Diversify to 40% Vietnam, 20% China, 20% Mexico, 20% US + increase inventory to 16 weeks

**Key Insight**: Best operators balance immediate crisis response with long-term strategic positioning. Don't just survive—use the crisis to build a more resilient business.
