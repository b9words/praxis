## Case Brief

### Company Overview

**DataFlow Analytics**
- **Industry**: B2B SaaS (Business Intelligence Platform)
- **Founded**: 2020
- **Stage**: Series A ($15M raised)
- **Location**: Seattle, WA
- **Team Size**: 65 employees

**Your Role**: VP of People (reporting to CEO)

### The Situation

DataFlow is a fast-growing analytics startup with strong product-market fit. The company is on track to hit $10M ARR this year, growing 200% YoY. Culture has been a competitive advantage—high employee satisfaction, low turnover, collaborative environment.

**The Problem:**

**Jason Chen**, the top-performing sales leader, is creating a toxic environment. Jason is a "rockstar"—he personally generates 40% of company revenue ($4M ARR), closes the biggest deals, and has relationships with key customers. But his behavior is destroying team morale.

**Recent Incidents:**

1. **Last Week**: Jason publicly humiliated a junior sales rep (Emma) in the all-hands meeting for losing a deal. Emma started crying and left the room. Three sales team members have come to you privately saying "this is unacceptable."

2. **Last Month**: Jason refused to help onboard a new sales hire (Tom), saying "I don't have time to babysit. If he can't figure it out, fire him." Tom struggled for 2 months and then quit. Exit interview: "Jason made my life hell."

3. **Ongoing**: Jason regularly misses team meetings, ignores requests from other departments (marketing, product), and refuses to use the CRM ("it's a waste of time—I know my deals"). The VP of Sales (Jason's manager) is unable to manage him.

**The Complication:**

Yesterday, you received an anonymous report via the company's ethics hotline:

```
"Jason makes inappropriate comments about female employees.
Last week, he told Sarah (Marketing Manager) her presentation
would be better if she 'smiled more and wore something more professional.'

He also jokes about his strip club expenses in Vegas
during sales trips. Multiple people are uncomfortable but afraid
to speak up because Jason is the CEO's favorite.

The company talks about values, but we don't live them.
If nothing changes, I'm quitting."
```

**This Morning's Leadership Team Meeting:**

**CEO (Rachel)**: "Jason closed a $1M deal yesterday. He's untouchable. We can't afford to lose him—he's 40% of our revenue. Yes, he's rough around the edges, but that's what makes him a great salesman. We need to focus on growing the company, not policing everyone's feelings."

**VP Sales (Mike)**: "I've tried to manage Jason. He doesn't listen to me. He goes around me directly to Rachel. I feel like I have no authority over my own team. This is a leadership problem, not just a Jason problem."

**VP Engineering (Lisa)**: "My team refuses to work with Jason. He yells at engineers when features aren't prioritized for his deals. Last week, he called my lead engineer an idiot in Slack. I'm about to lose top talent because of one person."

**CFO (Tom)**: "We're burning $800K/month. We need Jason's revenue. If we fire him, we miss our numbers, and Series B is in jeopardy. Can we just coach him? Give him a warning? Anything but losing him?"

**You (VP People)**: "This isn't about feelings—it's about our values and the law. We have a documented pattern of behavior including potential harassment. If we don't act, we're liable. And we'll lose more people than just Jason."

**Rachel (CEO)**: "Figure out a solution. I need options by tomorrow. All I know is we can't lose $4M in revenue."

Jan 2023     2               $500K      1 (refused to onboard new hire)
Feb 2023     4               $900K      2 (strip club comments, "smile more" comment to Sarah)
Mar 2023     3               $750K      0

Jun 2023     5               $1.3M      0 (pending—it's June 15)

Patterns:
  - Performance increasing (bigger deals, higher velocity)
  - Incidents increasing (from 0 to 1-2/month)
  - Incidents correlate with high-stress months (quota pressure)
  - No formal warnings given (VP Sales hasn't documented anything)
  - Incidents reported verbally but not formally investigated
```

### File 2: Legal & HR Risk Assessment

```
Consultation with Employment Attorney:

"You have significant legal exposure here. Let me break it down:

1. Hostile Work Environment (Potential Liability)
   - Multiple documented incidents of inappropriate behavior
   - Gender-based comments ("smile more", "dress more professionally")
   - Pattern of behavior creating intimidating environment
   - Company aware but has not taken corrective action
   - Risk: Lawsuit from current or former employee (high probability)
   - Damages: $500K-$2M (settlement or judgment)

2. Failure to Address Harassment (Negligence)
   - Anonymous ethics complaint = company is ON NOTICE
   - Failure to investigate = potential punitive damages
   - Must investigate within 7 days (best practice)
   - Risk: Company liable for Jason's actions (high probability)

3. Constructive Discharge (Former Employees)
   - Tom (quit) and others may claim hostile environment forced them to quit
   - If environment was so bad they had no choice but to leave = constructive discharge
   - Risk: Unemployment claims + potential wrongful termination suits
   - Damages: Back pay + front pay + emotional distress

4. Retaliation Risk (If Jason is Protected)
   - If employees perceive Jason is protected despite complaints = chilling effect
   - Others afraid to report = systemic problem
   - Risk: Culture of fear, more lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny

RECOMMENDATION:
  You MUST investigate the ethics complaint formally.
  You MUST interview witnesses.
  You MUST document findings.
  You MUST take action (coaching, PIP, or termination).
  Failure to act = negligence = company liable.

If Jason is terminated, risk of wrongful termination suit is LOW
  (he's at-will, documented poor behavior, multiple complaints).

If Jason is NOT terminated, risk of harassment suit is HIGH
  (company knew, didn't act, pattern of behavior continued).

Bottom line: Keeping Jason is riskier than firing him."

Estimated Legal Costs:
  Investigation: $10-15K (attorney time)
  If lawsuit filed: $100-300K (defense + settlement)
  If lawsuit goes to trial: $500K-$2M (judgment + reputation damage)
```

### File 3: Revenue Impact Analysis

```
Scenario 1: Keep Jason (Status Quo)
  Immediate Revenue: $4M/year (Jason's production)
  Team Revenue: $6M/year (rest of team)
  Total: $10M ARR
  
  12-Month Projection:
    Jason Revenue: $4M (continues)
    Team Churn: 3 more reps quit (toxic culture)
    Team Revenue: $4.5M (down from $6M)
    Total: $8.5M ARR (15% decline)
  
  Risk:
    - Lawsuits (50% probability, $500K-$2M cost)
    - Glassdoor rating tanks (hiring difficulty)
    - Top performers leave (Lisa's eng team)
    - Culture damage (long-term)

Scenario 2: Fire Jason Immediately
  Immediate Revenue Loss: $4M/year (Jason's book)
  
  12-Month Projection:
    Jason's Accounts: $2M retained (50% stay, assigned to team)
    New Hire(s): $1M (hire 2 reps, ramp 6 months)
    Existing Team: $7M (morale boost, 1 rep saved from quitting)
    Total: $10M ARR (no net change)
  
  Benefit:
    - Culture recovery (morale improves)
    - Retention improves (save 2-3 people from quitting)
    - Legal risk eliminated
    - Leadership credibility restored

Scenario 3: Coach Jason (PIP + Warnings)
  Immediate Revenue: $4M/year (Jason continues)
  
  12-Month Projection (Two Outcomes):
  
  Outcome A: Jason Improves (30% probability)
    - Jason moderates behavior
    - Team tolerates him (uneasy truce)
    - Revenue: $9.5M ARR
    - Culture: Mediocre but stable
  
  Outcome B: Jason Doesn't Improve (70% probability)
    - Incidents continue
    - More people quit
    - Legal exposure grows
    - Revenue: $8M ARR
    - Must fire Jason anyway (6 months wasted)

CEO's Concern:
  "If we fire Jason, we miss our Q3 and Q4 numbers.
  Series B investors will see declining revenue.
  They'll think we have a revenue problem, not a culture problem.
  How do I explain this to the board?"

CFO's Model:
  Keep Jason: $10M ARR (short-term) → $8.5M ARR (12 months) → lawsuit
  Fire Jason: $8M ARR (short-term) → $10M ARR (12 months) → healthy culture
  
  Net Present Value (3 years):
    Keep Jason: -$500K (lawsuits + turnover costs)
    Fire Jason: +$2M (retention + culture + growth)
```

### File 4: Team Sentiment (Confidential Survey)

```
Survey Question: "What should DataFlow do about Jason?"

Sales Team (9 responses, Jason excluded):

Fire Him (6 responses):
  "He's a cancer. I don't care how much he sells."
  "I'm actively looking for jobs because of him. If he stays, I'm gone."
  "Leadership keeps saying culture matters. Prove it."
  "He makes us all look bad. I'm embarrassed to work here."
  "I've lost 2 potential hires because they heard about him during references."
  "My spouse asks why I tolerate this. I don't have a good answer."

Coach Him (2 responses):
  "He's an asshole but he's OUR asshole. We need the revenue."
  "Maybe he'll change if we give him a serious warning?"

Other (1 response):
  "I don't know. I'm just trying to keep my head down and hit quota."

Engineering Team (15 responses):

Fire Him (13 responses):
  "I've never met someone so disrespectful. He treats engineers like servants."
  "We're building a product for customers, not for Jason's ego."
  "If he's not fired, I'm leaving. I have 3 offers from other companies."
  "This is a test of leadership. If we fail, I'll know this company isn't for me."
  "I joined because of the culture. Now I'm staying despite it. That won't last."

Give a Warning (2 responses):
  "Maybe he doesn't know how his behavior affects others? Feedback first?"
  "Is there a middle ground? Coaching + probation?"

Product/Marketing/Ops (12 responses):

Fire Him (10 responses):
  "He's a symptom of a bigger problem: we tolerate bad behavior from top performers."
  "If we keep him, what message does that send? Revenue > values?"
  "I've worked at companies that protected jerks. They all failed eventually."

Coach Him (2 responses):
  "Can we give him a chance to improve? Document and monitor?"
  "What if we're wrong? What if this is overblown?"

Anonymous Comments:
  "Sarah (marketing) is traumatized. She cries in the bathroom after meetings with Jason."
  "Jason called Emma a 'diversity hire.' That's not just rude—it's discriminatory."
  "I've heard him joke about 'which female employees he'd hook up with.' This is sexual harassment."
  "The CEO protects him. That's the real problem. If Rachel won't act, nothing will change."
```

### File 5: Comparable Case Studies (Industry Research)

```
Case Study 1: Uber (Travis Kalanick Era)
Situation:
  - CEO and top execs created toxic culture
  - High performance tolerated bad behavior
  - "Brilliant Jerks" were celebrated
  - Sexual harassment allegations surfaced

Outcome:
  - CEO forced out by board
  - Multiple execs fired
  - $20M+ in legal settlements
  - Brand damage (years to recover)
  - IPO delayed, valuation impacted

Lesson: "Protecting toxic performers destroys companies."

Case Study 2: Amazon (Pivot to "Striving to be Earth's Best Employer")
Situation:
  - Known for high-pressure culture, stack ranking
  - NYT expose on "bruising workplace"
  - High turnover, burnout

Outcome:
  - Leadership changed performance management system
  - Eliminated stack ranking
  - Invested in culture (parental leave, mental health)
  - Result: Retention improved, innovation continued

Lesson: "You can have high performance AND healthy culture."

Case Study 3: Tesla (Elon Musk's Leadership Style)
Situation:
  - Elon known for demanding, sometimes abrasive style
  - High turnover, lawsuits (sexual harassment, racism)
  - Top performers protected despite complaints

Outcome:
  - Some executives left (turnover)
  - Lawsuits settled (tens of millions)
  - Company continues to grow despite culture issues
  - Talent pool willing to tolerate culture for mission

Lesson: "Tolerance for toxicity varies by industry and mission."
  (Note: Tesla mission = existential, DataFlow = analytics SaaS)

Case Study 4: Netflix (Keeper Test + No Brilliant Jerks)
Situation:
  - High-performance culture, but explicit: "No brilliant jerks"
  - "Keeper test": Would you fight to keep this person?
  - If no = generous severance, move on

Outcome:
  - Top performers who are toxic = shown the door
  - Culture of respect + excellence
  - Low turnover among top talent
  - Sustained growth ($30B+ revenue)

Lesson: "You can have standards for both performance AND behavior."

Recommendation from Industry Research:
  Companies that tolerate toxic top performers:
    - Short-term revenue gain
    - Long-term culture damage
    - High legal costs
    - Talent exodus

  Companies that fire toxic top performers:
    - Short-term revenue dip (6-12 months)
    - Long-term culture gain
    - Lower legal costs
    - Talent magnet (best people want to work there)

Winner: Companies that set clear behavioral standards early.
```

## Decision Points

### Decision Point 1: Immediate Action (Next 48 Hours)

**Situation**: You must respond to the ethics complaint and CEO's request for options.

**What is your recommendation to the CEO?**

**Option A: Fire Jason Immediately**
```
Action:
  - Terminate Jason for cause (pattern of behavior, ethics violation)
  - Generous severance (6 months pay = $75K to avoid wrongful termination claim)
  - Assign his accounts to existing team + hire 2 new reps
  - All-hands communication: "We live our values, no exceptions"

Pros:
  ✅ Sends clear cultural message
  ✅ Eliminates legal risk
  ✅ Improves morale immediately
  ✅ Retains other top talent (engineers, product)
  ✅ Protects company reputation

Cons:
  ❌ Loses $4M revenue (40% of total)
  ❌ Q3/Q4 miss (impacts Series B)
  ❌ Customer relationships at risk (Jason owns accounts)
  ❌ CEO loses her "favorite"
  ❌ Short-term pain (before long-term gain)

Financial Impact:
  Short-term (6 months): $8M ARR (from $10M)
  Long-term (12 months): $10M ARR (back to baseline)
  Legal savings: $500K-$2M (avoided lawsuits)
  Retention savings: $300K (avoid replacing 3 people)
```

**Option B: Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)**
```
Action:
  - Formal investigation (interview witnesses, document)
  - 90-day PIP with specific behavioral goals
  - Weekly check-ins with VP Sales + monthly with you
  - Zero tolerance for additional incidents
  - Termination if any violation during PIP

Pros:
  ✅ Shows "fairness" (gave him a chance)
  ✅ Keeps revenue during PIP period
  ✅ Legally defensible (documented process)
  ✅ May actually reform Jason (5-10% chance)

Cons:
  ❌ Signals "top performers get chances, others don't"
  ❌ 90 days of continued toxicity (team suffers)
  ❌ Likely ends in termination anyway (70% chance)
  ❌ Delays culture recovery
  ❌ Team sees it as "slap on wrist"
  ❌ Legal risk continues during PIP

Financial Impact:
  Short-term (3 months): $10M ARR (no change)
  Long-term (12 months): $8.5M ARR (if Jason fired after PIP)
  Legal risk: $300K-$1M (lawsuits still possible during PIP)
  Turnover risk: 2-3 people quit during PIP (frustrated by inaction)
```

**Option C: Forced Coaching + Behavioral Coach**
```
Action:
  - Mandatory executive coaching (3 months, $15K investment)
  - Behavioral expectations document (signed agreement)
  - No PIP (yet), but explicit warning
  - Monthly 360 feedback from team
  - If no improvement after 3 months → PIP or termination

Pros:
  ✅ Shows investment in people development
  ✅ Keeps revenue during coaching period
  ✅ May create behavior change (10-20% chance)
  ✅ CEO can tell board "we tried everything"

Cons:
  ❌ Sends message "coaching is punishment for bad behavior"
  ❌ Team skeptical (already lost trust)
  ❌ Jason may not engage authentically
  ❌ 3 months of continued low morale
  ❌ Legal risk continues

Financial Impact:
  Short-term (3 months): $10M ARR (no change)
  Long-term (12 months): $8.5M ARR (if coaching fails)
  Coaching Cost: $15K
  Turnover risk: 1-2 people quit (frustrated by delay)
```

**Option D: Restructure Role (Remove from Management, Keep as IC)**
```
Action:
  - Remove Jason from leadership track
  - Individual contributor only (no direct reports, no team influence)
  - Office in different location (physical separation)
  - Limited cross-functional work (minimize contact)
  - Strict behavioral expectations + monitoring

Pros:
  ✅ Keeps revenue ($4M)
  ✅ Reduces harm (limited contact with team)
  ✅ Shows consequences (demotion)
  ✅ Avoids termination (CEO doesn't have to "lose" Jason)

Cons:
  ❌ Jason may quit (ego hit)
  ❌ Doesn't solve root problem (behavior)
  ❌ Team still knows he's protected
  ❌ Hard to enforce isolation (customers, deals)
  ❌ Sends confusing message ("toxic but valuable")

Financial Impact:
  Short-term: $10M ARR (if Jason stays)
  Risk: Jason quits anyway (50% chance)
  Long-term: $9M ARR (middle ground)
```

**Your Complete Investigation Plan:**
[Text area for detailed plan]

### Decision Point 3: CEO Pushback (The Hard Conversation)

**Situation**: You present your recommendation (let's assume you recommended termination). CEO pushes back.

**CEO Rachel's Response:**

"I hear you, but I disagree. Here's why:

1. **Revenue**: We can't afford to lose $4M. That's 40% of our business. Series B investors will see declining revenue and think we're in trouble. Our valuation will tank.

2. **Customers**: Jason owns relationships with our 5 biggest customers. If he leaves, they might churn. That's not just $4M in ARR—it's $4M+ in future expansion.

3. **Team**: Yes, some people don't like Jason. But some people don't like anyone. We can't fire every person someone complains about. We'd have no one left.

4. **Fairness**: Jason has never been formally warned. We haven't given him a PIP. How is it fair to fire him without giving him a chance to improve?

5. **Legal**: Our lawyer is being conservative. We're not going to get sued. And even if we did, we have insurance. That's what D&O insurance is for.

6. **Personal**: Jason and I have a relationship. He was one of our first hires. I recruited him. I promised him we'd build something great together. I can't just throw him away because he's rough around the edges.

Bottom line: I'm not comfortable firing him. Give me another option."

**How do you respond to the CEO?**

**Your Response:**
[Text area for your argument]

**Required Components:**
1. **Acknowledge her concerns** (don't dismiss them)
2. **Counter each argument with data** (financial, legal, cultural)
3. **Reframe the question** (not "can we afford to fire him?" but "can we afford to keep him?")
4. **Offer compromise** (if appropriate, or hold firm)
5. **Escalate if necessary** (board involvement if CEO refuses)

**Consider:**
- What if the CEO refuses your recommendation?
- Do you resign? Go to the board? Comply reluctantly?
- What are the ethical implications of each choice?

### Decision Point 4: Post-Decision Implementation

**Situation**: A decision has been made (fire, PIP, coaching, or keep). Now you must implement.

**Scenario A: If Jason is Terminated**

**Implementation Plan:**

**Step 1: Termination Meeting (Day 1)**
```
Who attends? _____
What is said? _____
Severance offered? $_____
Non-disparagement agreement? Yes/No
```

**Step 2: Customer Transition (Day 1-7)**
```
How do you transition Jason's accounts?
  - Assign to specific reps? (Who?)
  - CEO personal outreach? (Which customers?)
  - Offer continuity reassurance? (What message?)

Your Plan: _____
```

**Step 3: Team Communication (Day 1)**
```
All-hands message:
  Option A: Transparent ("Jason no longer with company due to behavioral issues")
  Option B: Vague ("Jason moving on, we wish him well")
  Option C: Values-focused ("We take culture seriously, made difficult decision")

Your Message: _____
```

## AI Coach Prompts

**Persona: Dr. Angela Martinez, Former Chief People Officer at Airbnb**

**Coaching Style**: Values-driven, asks probing ethical questions, pushes for courage

**Sample Dialogue:**

Student: "I'd put Jason on a PIP to give him a chance to improve."

Angela: "Why? Do you actually believe he'll change? Be honest."

Student: "Well, maybe 10-20% chance. But it's fair to give him a chance."

Angela: "Fair to whom? Let me ask you a different question: Is it fair to Sarah, who was told to 'smile more'? Is it fair to Emma, who cried in front of the whole company? Is it fair to Tom, who quit because Jason refused to help him? Who are you being fair to by keeping Jason?"

Student: "I guess... I'm being fair to Jason and the CEO."

Angela: "Exactly. And that's a choice. You're prioritizing one person (Jason) and one stakeholder (CEO) over the entire team. Now, maybe that's the right choice for business reasons—I can see the revenue argument. But let's be clear-eyed: This isn't about fairness. This is about: 'Can we afford to fire our top performer?' That's a different question. So let's answer THAT question. Can you afford to fire him? Walk me through the math."

**Debrief Focus Areas:**
1. Did the student make a clear decision or hedge/waffle?
2. Did they consider second-order effects (turnover, culture, reputation)?
3. Did they address the CEO pushback with conviction or cave?
4. Did they balance revenue vs. values or prioritize one?
5. Did they create a realistic implementation plan or just decide and stop?

## Expected Insights

Strong students will recognize:

1. **This is not a "business case"—it's a values test**
   - Revenue analysis matters, but this is fundamentally about culture
   - Companies that tolerate toxic performers destroy themselves slowly
   - Short-term revenue gain ≠ long-term value creation

2. **The CEO is the real problem, not Jason**
   - Jason is a symptom; leadership tolerance is the disease
   - CEO's relationship with Jason is blinding her judgment
   - If CEO won't act, VP People must escalate to board or resign

3. **Legal risk is real and significant**
   - $500K-$2M exposure is not hypothetical
   - Anonymous ethics complaint = company is ON NOTICE
   - Failure to investigate/act = negligence = company liable

4. **"Fair" means different things to different people**
   - Fair to Jason = give him a chance (PIP, coaching)
   - Fair to the team = hold everyone to same standards
   - Fair to the company = protect culture + legal + financial interests
   - Must explicitly choose whose "fairness" matters most

5. **Implementation matters as much as decision**
   - Deciding to fire Jason is 20% of the work
   - Customer transition, team communication, hiring plan = 80%
   - Culture recovery takes 6-12 months (not immediate)

**The Winning Answer**: 

Fire Jason immediately. Here's why:

1. **Financial**: Short-term $2M revenue loss, long-term $2M+ gain (legal savings + retention + culture)
2. **Legal**: Eliminates $500K-$2M liability, protects company
3. **Cultural**: Sends clear message "we live our values," retains top talent (Lisa, others)
4. **Strategic**: Builds sustainable culture, not revenue dependent on one person

**Implementation**: Generous severance ($75K), personal CEO calls to Jason's customers, promote 1 internal rep + hire 1 external senior rep, all-hands with transparent explanation ("we take culture seriously, made difficult decision"), culture recovery plan (listening tours, updated values, leadership training).

**CEO Pushback Response**: "Rachel, I understand your concerns. But here's the reframe: We can't afford to KEEP him. Keeping Jason costs us $2M in legal risk, $300K in turnover, and our reputation. Firing him costs us $2M in revenue that we'll recover in 12 months. This isn't a revenue decision—it's a culture decision. And culture is strategy. If we don't act, we lose Lisa, Emma, Sarah, and others. We become the company no one wants to work for. Is that the company you want to build? Because I can help you build that company, but I can't do it with integrity if we keep Jason."

**Key Insight**: The best leaders make hard decisions that hurt in the short term but build sustainable organizations in the long term. Courage is a leadership skill.
