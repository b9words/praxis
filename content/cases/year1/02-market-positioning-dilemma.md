## Case Brief

### Company Overview

**FitTrack Pro**
- **Industry**: Fitness & Wellness Technology
- **Founded**: 2020
- **Stage**: Seed ($2M raised, 12 months runway)
- **Location**: Austin, TX
- **Team Size**: 18 employees

**Your Role**: Head of Strategy & Growth (reporting to CEO/Founder)

### The Situation

FitTrack Pro launched 18 months ago as a **B2C fitness tracking app** (think: Strava meets MyFitnessPal with AI coaching). The app has 50,000 registered users, 5,000 paying subscribers ($9.99/month), and MRR of $50,000.

**The Unexpected Pivot Opportunity:**

Three months ago, the company received an inbound inquiry from **CorpWell**, a corporate wellness company managing fitness programs for 200 enterprises (2M employees total). CorpWell wants to white-label FitTrack Pro's technology for their corporate clients.

**The Proposed Deal:**
- **Initial Contract**: $500K/year (10x current ARR)
- **Potential**: 20-30 similar corporate wellness companies
- **Total Market**: $50M+ annual opportunity
- **Requirements**: Significant product changes (admin dashboards, HIPAA compliance, SSO, reporting)

**The Founder's Dilemma:**

CEO/Founder Alex is torn:
- "We started this company to help individuals live healthier lives. That's our mission."
- "But B2C is brutal—CAC is $45, churn is 6%/month, we're burning cash."
- "B2B could make us profitable in 6 months. But are we abandoning our vision?"

**Board Perspective:**
- Lead investor: "Take the B2B deal. You're running out of cash. Pivot fully to enterprise."
- Angel investor: "Stay B2C. Consumer is where the big outcomes happen (think Peloton, MyFitnessPal)."
- You (Strategy lead): Need to analyze data and make recommendation.

  "Consumer fitness apps face existential challenges:
   1. Most users expect free (ad-supported)
   2. Hardware companies (Apple, Google) bundle apps free
   3. CAC rising 20-30%/year due to competition
   4. Only very large players (10M+ users) achieve profitability
   5. M&A likely for mid-sized players (acquihire or shutdown)"

## Decision Points

### Decision Point 1: Strategic Direction (Immediate)

**Situation**: CorpWell wants an answer in 2 weeks. Do you pursue B2B, stay B2C, or try both?

**Option A: Full Pivot to B2B** (Abandon B2C)
```
Strategy:
  - Accept CorpWell deal
  - Freeze B2C feature development
  - Reallocate team to enterprise features
  - Hire B2B sales team (3 people)
  - Maintain B2C app in "maintenance mode" (no new features)

Pros:
  ✅ Immediate revenue ($500K/year contract)
  ✅ Path to profitability (6-12 months)
  ✅ Better unit economics (higher LTV, lower churn)
  ✅ Less competition than B2C
  ✅ Potential acquisition exit ($15-20M)

Cons:
  ❌ Abandon original mission (help individuals)
  ❌ Cultural shift (consumer → enterprise)
  ❌ Single customer risk (CorpWell = 80% revenue)
  ❌ Product becomes boring (admin dashboards vs AI coaching)
  ❌ May lose consumer-focused team members
  ❌ Harder to pivot back if B2B fails

Financial Impact:
  Month 6: $42K MRR (CorpWell) + $30K MRR (B2C maintenance)
  Month 12: $150K MRR (CorpWell expanded + 2 new clients)
  Month 24: $350K MRR (10+ enterprise clients)
  Profitability: Month 8-10 (break-even)
```

**Option B: Stay B2C** (Decline CorpWell, double down on consumer)
```
Strategy:
  - Decline CorpWell deal
  - Focus 100% on improving B2C metrics
  - Improve retention (reduce churn to 3%/month)
  - Optimize CAC (improve conversion, reduce ad spend)
  - Differentiate product (unique AI features)
  - Raise Series A ($5M) if metrics improve

Pros:
  ✅ Stay true to original vision
  ✅ Maintain product culture (consumer focus)
  ✅ Larger market potential ($50B+ vs $2B)
  ✅ Better brand (direct relationship with users)
  ✅ Potential for viral growth

Cons:
  ❌ Runway risk (12 months, need to improve metrics)
  ❌ Competitive market (giants like Google, Apple)
  ❌ Rising CAC (unsustainable trend)
  ❌ Declining LTV:CAC (now at 2.1:1, need 3:1+)
  ❌ May not raise Series A if metrics don't improve
  ❌ Could run out of money

Financial Impact:
  Month 6: $65K MRR (improved retention + conversion)
  Month 12: $100K MRR (if metrics improve significantly)
  Month 18: $180K MRR (need to raise Series A by month 12)
  Profitability: Month 24-36 (if everything goes right)
  Risk: 40% chance of failure (run out of money)
```

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (Do both B2B and B2C)
```
Strategy:
  - Accept CorpWell deal
  - Continue B2C investment (maintain team)
  - Hire additional B2B resources (separate team)
  - Build shared platform (serves both B2C and B2B)
  - Use B2B revenue to fund B2C growth

Pros:
  ✅ Don't have to choose (hedge bets)
  ✅ B2B revenue funds B2C innovation
  ✅ Keep optionality (can go either direction)
  ✅ Team stays motivated (both missions)
  ✅ Risk mitigation (diversified revenue)

Cons:
  ❌ Resource split (may underperform in both)
  ❌ Product complexity (one codebase, two customers)
  ❌ Higher burn rate (need both teams)
  ❌ Focus dilution (context switching costly)
  ❌ May end up mediocre in both B2C and B2B
  ❌ CorpWell may want 100% focus, not 50%

Financial Impact:
  Month 6: $42K (CorpWell) + $50K (B2C) = $92K MRR
  Month 12: $100K (B2B) + $75K (B2C) = $175K MRR
  Costs increase $100K/month (dual teams)
  Profitability: Month 18-24 (if both work)
  Risk: 60% chance neither excels (resource split)
```

**Your Recommendation:**
[Text area for student decision with detailed justification]

**Required Analysis:**
- Financial model (24-month projection for each option)
- Risk assessment (probability-weighted outcomes)
- Team impact analysis
- Market timing considerations

### Decision Point 2: The Counteroffer (Plot Twist!)

**Situation**: You present your recommendation. Then CorpWell CEO calls with a counteroffer...

**CorpWell's Revised Proposal:**
```
"We love your product. Here's a better deal:

Option D: Strategic Partnership + Investment
  - $1M investment (equity, ~20% of company)
  - $500K/year service contract (as before)
  - Total: $1.5M immediate capital
  - CorpWell gets 2 board seats
  - Exclusive partnership (can't work with competing wellness companies)
  - Path to acquisition in 24 months ($20M+)

Terms:
  ✓ You get cash to extend runway (30+ months)
  ✓ We get guaranteed priority + influence
  ✓ You build for us first, but can maintain B2C
  ✓ We help with B2B sales (warm intros to our clients)
  ✓ Acquisition option after 24 months (both sides must agree)
  
Catch:
  ✗ 20% dilution (founders go from 60% to 48%)
  ✗ CorpWell influence (board control risk)
  ✗ Exclusivity (can't work with Virgin Pulse, Wellable, etc.)
  ✗ Implicit pressure to sell in 24 months

Our CEO: 'This is a win-win. You get funded, we get technology. Think about it—this solves your runway problem AND gives you optionality. But we need an answer in 48 hours.'"
```

**Does this change your recommendation?**

**Analysis Required:**
- Compare Option D (partnership + investment) vs Options A/B/C
- Valuation analysis (is 20% for $1M fair?)
- Control analysis (2 board seats = how much influence?)
- Exit analysis (acquisition in 24 months vs. staying independent)
- Exclusivity analysis (what's the cost of not working with other B2B customers?)

**Consider:**
- **If you decline**: Stick with original plan (A, B, or C)
- **If you accept**: New option (D) with pros/cons

**Your Revised Recommendation:**
[Text area for updated analysis]

### Decision Point 3: Product Strategy (Assuming B2B Pivot)

**Situation**: You decided to pursue B2B (either Option A or D). Now you need to determine product strategy.

**The Product Dilemma:**

Current FitTrack Pro is a **consumer-grade** app:
- Beautiful UX, gamification, social features
- Fast iteration (ship features weekly)
- Focused on individual motivation

Enterprise clients need **business-grade** features:
- Admin dashboards, compliance, security
- Slow, methodical releases (quarterly)
- Focused on ROI reporting, cost savings

**Product Architecture Options:**

**Option A: Single Codebase (Shared Platform)**
```
Strategy:
  - One app serves both B2C and B2B users
  - Feature flags enable/disable enterprise features
  - Consumer features available to enterprise users
  
Pros:
  ✅ Simpler to maintain (one codebase)
  ✅ Faster development (shared features)
  ✅ Cross-pollination (B2B users get B2C innovations)
  
Cons:
  ❌ Complexity (feature flags everywhere)
  ❌ Compromise (neither B2C nor B2B optimized)
  ❌ Enterprise features clutter consumer app
  ❌ Security risk (consumer and enterprise data in same DB)

Timeline: 4 months to build enterprise features
Cost: $200K
```

**Option B: Separate Codebases (Purpose-Built)**
```
Strategy:
  - FitTrack Consumer (existing app, consumer-optimized)
  - FitTrack Enterprise (new app, built for corporate)
  - Shared API backend (common services)
  
Pros:
  ✅ Optimized UX for each audience
  ✅ Simpler to reason about (clear separation)
  ✅ Better security (isolated environments)
  ✅ Easier to sell/maintain each product
  
Cons:
  ❌ Higher development cost (build twice)
  ❌ Slower feature development (duplicate work)
  ❌ More complex infrastructure (2 apps, 1 backend)
  ❌ Risk of drift (apps diverge over time)

Timeline: 6 months to build enterprise app
Cost: $300K
```

**Option C: White-Label Only (No FitTrack Branding for Enterprise)**
```
Strategy:
  - CorpWell (and others) brand as their own product
  - FitTrack is invisible to end users
  - Fully customizable (colors, logo, features)
  
Pros:
  ✅ Higher margins (B2B clients pay premium for white-label)
  ✅ Easier sales (clients don't compete with FitTrack consumer brand)
  ✅ Flexibility (each client gets custom experience)
  
Cons:
  ❌ No brand building (enterprise users don't know FitTrack)
  ❌ Custom work for each client (not scalable)
  ❌ Complex deployment (manage multiple instances)
  ❌ Harder to cross-sell from B2B to B2C

Timeline: 5 months to build white-label platform
Cost: $250K
```

**Your Product Strategy Recommendation:**
[Text area for decision]

**Consider:**
- Long-term vision (are you a B2C company with B2B revenue, or vice versa?)
- Team capability (can you maintain 2 codebases?)
- Customer expectation (does CorpWell want white-label or FitTrack-branded?)
- Scalability (can you onboard 20+ enterprise clients with this architecture?)

## AI Coach Prompts

**Persona: Marcus Johnson, Former VP Strategy at Salesforce**

**Coaching Style**: Socratic method, pushes student to think through second-order effects

**Sample Dialogue:**

Student: "I think we should pivot to B2B because it's more profitable."

Marcus: "More profitable? Walk me through that. What's your gross margin assumption for B2B vs B2C? Have you accounted for the $180K/month in new costs—sales team, enterprise engineers, customer success? At $500K/year from CorpWell, you're at $42K/month revenue. That's still burning cash, isn't it?"

Student: "Right, but we can get more B2B customers after CorpWell."

Marcus: "How many? How fast? What's your sales cycle? If it's 6-12 months, that means you close your first new customer beyond CorpWell around Month 9-12. Can you survive that long? Show me your cash flow projection month by month."

Student: "We'd have $2M + $500K from CorpWell = $2.5M."

Marcus: "But the $500K is over 12 months, so it's $42K/month. And you're spending $217K current + $180K new B2B costs = $397K/month. So you're burning $355K/month. You have 7 months of runway, not 12. What do you do?"

**Debrief Focus Areas:**
1. Did the student do rigorous financial modeling or hand-wave assumptions?
2. Did they consider customer concentration risk (CorpWell = 80% of revenue)?
3. Did they think through team/culture implications of pivot?
4. Did they evaluate the counteroffer (Option D) vs. original options?
5. Did they create a realistic GTM plan or generic platitudes?

Strong students will recognize:

1. **This is not a binary choice—there's a spectrum**
   - Full pivot B2B (Option A)
   - Stay B2C (Option B)
   - Hybrid (Option C)
   - Partnership + Investment (Option D)
   Each has trade-offs

2. **B2C metrics are deteriorating and may be unsustainable**
   - LTV:CAC declining from 6:1 to 2:1
   - Need 3:1+ to be viable long-term
   - Rising CAC + declining conversion = death spiral

3. **B2B is attractive but has execution risk**
   - Single customer dependency (CorpWell = 80% revenue initially)
   - 6 months to implement (burn cash during transition)
   - Cultural shift (consumer → enterprise)
   - May not be able to pivot back if B2B fails

4. **Option D (partnership + investment) is interesting but has strings**
   - Solves runway problem ($1.5M immediate capital)
   - But: 20% dilution, board influence, exclusivity constraints
   - Valuation seems fair ($5M post-money for seed-stage company)
   - Risk: CorpWell controls destiny (acquisition pressure)

5. **The "right" answer depends on founder's risk tolerance and vision**
   - Risk-averse founder: Take Option D (partnership + cash + optionality)
   - Risk-seeking founder: Stay B2C, improve metrics, raise Series A
   - Pragmatic founder: Full B2B pivot (Option A), survive, build valuable company

**No single "correct" answer—but the analysis quality matters.**

**The Winning Approach**: Clear-eyed assessment of B2C deterioration, realistic B2B modeling (including 6-month implementation burn), thoughtful evaluation of Option D, and a coherent GTM plan that matches chosen strategy.
