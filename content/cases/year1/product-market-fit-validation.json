    "situation": "HealthTrack is a 18-month-old startup building a platform to help primary care physicians coordinate care for patients with chronic conditions. The founding team includes 2 physicians and 2 engineers. You're the Head of Product, brought in 6 months ago to scale the product.\n\nThe company raised a $3M seed round 12 months ago. Current situation:\n- 45 physician practices signed up (target was 200)\n- Only 18 practices are 'active' (used in past 30 days)\n- Among active practices, usage is mixed: some love it, some barely touch it\n- Burn rate: $250K/month (12 months runway remaining)\n- The CEO believes the problem is sales/marketing execution, not the product\n- Your product instincts say something deeper is wrong\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n- A large hospital system expressed interest but wants completely different features\n- Your most engaged users are using the product in ways you didn't intend\n- Churn is 25% in the first 3 months\n- NPS is 35 (mixed signals: promoters love it, detractors hate it)\n- The original value proposition (\"coordinate care seamlessly\") isn't resonating in sales calls\n\nThe CEO has asked you to present at next week's board meeting: \"Are we on track or do we need to pivot?\"",
