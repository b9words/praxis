    "situation": "DataViz Pro is a 4-year-old B2B analytics platform with $18M ARR. The company has grown steadily but faces increasing competitive pressure. You're the VP of Revenue Operations, tasked with analyzing whether the current pricing model is optimal.\n\n**Current Pricing Model:**\n- Seat-based: $99/user/month\n- Enterprise tier: $199/user/month (advanced features)\n- No usage-based component\n- Average contract: 15 seats = $1,485/month\n\n**The Problem:**\nRecent customer research and sales team feedback suggest the pricing model is causing friction:\n- Small teams (5-10 users) find it expensive and often churn after 6 months\n- Large enterprises (100+ potential users) deploy to only 20-30 seats due to cost\n- A competitor just launched with usage-based pricing and is winning deals\n- Sales team reports losing deals due to \"complicated ROI calculation\"\n- Power users create significant value but don't generate more revenue\n\nThe CEO wants a comprehensive pricing strategy recommendation for next quarter's launch.",
