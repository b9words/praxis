# Unit Economics: CAC, LTV, and Payback Period

## Core Principle

Unit economics is the foundation of sustainable business growth. It answers the fundamental question: "Do we make money on each customer?" Understanding Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), and Payback Period enables you to make informed decisions about marketing spend, pricing, and growth strategy.

## The Framework

### 1. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
**Definition**: The total cost to acquire one new customer
**Formula**: CAC = Total Marketing & Sales Expenses / Number of New Customers Acquired

**Components to Include**:
- Advertising spend (Google, Facebook, etc.)
- Sales team salaries and commissions
- Marketing team salaries
- Marketing tools and software
- Content creation costs
- Events and conferences

### 2. Lifetime Value (LTV)
**Definition**: The total revenue a customer generates over their entire relationship
**Formula**: LTV = Average Revenue Per Customer × Gross Margin % × Average Customer Lifespan

**For Subscription Businesses**:
LTV = (Monthly Recurring Revenue × Gross Margin %) / Monthly Churn Rate

### 3. Payback Period
**Definition**: How long it takes to recover the cost of acquiring a customer
**Formula**: Payback Period = CAC / (Monthly Revenue per Customer × Gross Margin %)

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Blended CAC Confusion
**The Problem**: Averaging CAC across all channels hides poor-performing channels.
**Example**: 
- Google Ads CAC: $200
- Organic/Referral CAC: $50
- Blended CAC: $125
**Solution**: Track CAC by channel, cohort, and customer segment.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Gross Margin in LTV
**The Problem**: Using revenue instead of profit in LTV calculations.
**Example**: 
- Customer pays $100/month
- Cost to serve: $30/month
- LTV should use $70 (gross profit), not $100 (revenue)

### Pitfall 3: Static LTV Assumptions
**The Problem**: Assuming LTV remains constant as you scale.
**Reality**: LTV often decreases as you expand to less ideal customers.

## Application Example

**Scenario**: You're the CMO of a B2B SaaS company deciding how to allocate a $500K marketing budget.

**Channel Analysis**:

| Channel | CAC | LTV | LTV:CAC | Payback | Monthly Volume |
|---------|-----|-----|---------|---------|----------------|
| Google Ads | $400 | $2,400 | 6:1 | 8 months | 50 customers |
| Content Marketing | $200 | $3,000 | 15:1 | 4 months | 20 customers |
| Outbound Sales | $800 | $4,500 | 5.6:1 | 12 months | 30 customers |
| Referrals | $100 | $3,500 | 35:1 | 2 months | 10 customers |

**Analysis**:
1. **Referrals** have the best unit economics but limited scale
2. **Content Marketing** offers strong ROI with moderate scale
3. **Google Ads** provides good volume with acceptable economics
4. **Outbound Sales** has the longest payback period

**Decision Framework**:
1. **Maximize high-ROI, scalable channels**: Invest heavily in content marketing
2. **Scale proven channels**: Increase Google Ads spend while monitoring CAC inflation
3. **Invest in referral systems**: Build features to increase referral volume
4. **Optimize underperforming channels**: Improve outbound sales targeting to reduce CAC

**Budget Allocation**:
- Content Marketing: $200K (40%)
- Google Ads: $200K (40%)
- Referral Program: $50K (10%)
- Outbound Sales Optimization: $50K (10%)

**Key Metrics to Monitor**:
- CAC by channel and cohort
- LTV by customer segment
- Payback period trends
- LTV:CAC ratio (target: >3:1)
- Monthly cash flow impact

This systematic approach to unit economics ensures sustainable growth and prevents the common mistake of buying growth at unsustainable unit economics.
