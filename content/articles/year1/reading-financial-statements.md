# Reading the Three Financial Statements

## Core Principle

Financial statements are the language of business. Every business decision ultimately impacts one or more of these three core statements: the Income Statement (P&L), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. Mastering the ability to read and interpret these statements is fundamental to making informed business decisions.

## The Framework

### 1. The Income Statement (P&L)
**Purpose**: Shows profitability over a period of time
**Key Components**:
- **Revenue**: Total money coming in from sales
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: Direct costs to produce/deliver the product
- **Gross Profit**: Revenue - COGS
- **Operating Expenses**: Indirect costs (marketing, admin, R&D)
- **Operating Income**: Gross Profit - Operating Expenses
- **Net Income**: Final profit after all expenses and taxes

### 2. The Balance Sheet
**Purpose**: Shows financial position at a specific point in time
**Key Components**:
- **Assets**: What the company owns (cash, inventory, equipment)
- **Liabilities**: What the company owes (debt, accounts payable)
- **Equity**: Owner's stake in the company
- **Golden Rule**: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

### 3. The Cash Flow Statement
**Purpose**: Shows actual cash movement over a period
**Key Components**:
- **Operating Cash Flow**: Cash from core business operations
- **Investing Cash Flow**: Cash from buying/selling assets
- **Financing Cash Flow**: Cash from debt, equity, dividends

## Common Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Confusing Profit with Cash
**The Problem**: A company can be profitable but cash-poor, or cash-rich but unprofitable.
**Example**: A software company books $1M in annual contracts (revenue) but customers pay monthly. They show $1M revenue but only received $83K in cash.

### Pitfall 2: Ignoring Working Capital
**The Problem**: Not understanding how inventory, receivables, and payables affect cash flow.
**Example**: A retailer grows sales 50% but doesn't account for the cash needed to buy more inventory upfront.

### Pitfall 3: Focusing Only on the Bottom Line
**The Problem**: Net income can be manipulated through accounting choices. Operating metrics tell the real story.
**Example**: A company shows growing profits but declining gross margins, indicating pricing pressure or rising costs.

## Application Example

**Scenario**: You're evaluating two SaaS companies for potential investment.

**Company A**:
- Revenue: $10M (growing 100% YoY)
- Net Income: -$2M
- Operating Cash Flow: $1M
- Cash on Hand: $15M

**Company B**:
- Revenue: $10M (growing 20% YoY)
- Net Income: $1M
- Operating Cash Flow: -$500K
- Cash on Hand: $2M

**Analysis**:
- Company A is investing heavily in growth (negative net income) but generating positive operating cash flow, indicating strong unit economics
- Company B appears profitable but has negative operating cash flow, suggesting potential collection issues or unsustainable accounting practices
- Company A has a stronger cash position to weather challenges

**Decision Framework**:
1. Start with operating cash flow (most reliable indicator)
2. Analyze revenue quality and growth sustainability
3. Assess cash runway and capital requirements
4. Look for trends across all three statements

This systematic approach to financial statement analysis enables data-driven decision making and helps identify both opportunities and red flags in any business situation.
