### Core Principle

**Performance management is not an annual event—it's a continuous system.**

Most companies get this wrong. They treat performance reviews as a once-a-year bureaucratic checkbox: fill out forms, have uncomfortable conversation, assign rating, forget until next year.

**The Reality:**
- **Top performers need continuous feedback** (not annual)
- **Underperformers need immediate intervention** (not "wait until review")
- **Teams need clarity on expectations** (not vague goals)
- **Organizations need calibration** (not individual manager bias)

**Great performance management = Continuous feedback + Clear expectations + Fair evaluation + Development focus**

**Why This Matters:**
- **Retention**: #1 reason people quit = unclear expectations + lack of feedback
- **Productivity**: Clear goals + feedback = 2-3x performance improvement
- **Culture**: Performance management signals what matters
- **Fairness**: Transparent system prevents bias and politics
- **Growth**: Development focus = learning organization

Google's research: Managers who give regular feedback have teams that are 30% more productive and 20% less likely to quit.

### The Framework / Model

#### **THE CONTINUOUS PERFORMANCE MODEL**

**Traditional (Annual Reviews Only):**
```
Jan ──────────────────────────────── Dec
  |                                    |
Goal                                 Review
Setting                              (too late!)

Problems:
  - Feedback once/year = too late to improve
  - Goals set in January irrelevant by December
  - "Recency bias" (only remember last 2 months)
  - No course correction
  - Surprises in reviews = destroyed trust
```

**Modern (Continuous):**
```
Jan ─ Feb ─ Mar ─ Apr ─ May ─ Jun ─ Jul ─ Aug ─ Sep ─ Oct ─ Nov ─ Dec
 |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
Set  1:1  1:1  1:1  1:1  Mid  1:1  1:1  1:1  1:1  1:1  Year
OKRs Check Check Check Check Review Check Check Check Check Check Review

Continuous:
  - Weekly/bi-weekly 1:1s (real-time feedback)
  - Mid-year calibration (course correct)
  - Year-end review (summary, no surprises)
  - Ongoing development conversations
```

**Result**: No surprises, continuous improvement, trust

#### **THE 4 COMPONENTS OF PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT**

**1. GOAL SETTING (What Success Looks Like)**

**Framework: OKRs (Objectives + Key Results)**

**Structure:**
```
Objective: Ambitious, qualitative, inspirational
  - What do we want to achieve?
  - Qualitative direction

Key Results: Measurable, time-bound, outcomes
  - How will we know we're successful?
  - 3-5 metrics

Format:
  Objective: [Verb] [What you want to accomplish]
  Key Result 1: [Metric] from [X] to [Y] by [Date]
  Key Result 2: [Metric] from [X] to [Y] by [Date]
  Key Result 3: [Metric] from [X] to [Y] by [Date]
```

**Example: Product Manager OKRs (Q1 2024)**
```
Objective 1: Dramatically improve user onboarding experience

Key Results:
  - Increase signup-to-activation rate from 40% to 65%
  - Reduce time-to-first-value from 15 min to 5 min
  - Achieve NPS of 50+ for new users (up from 30)

Objective 2: Establish product-market fit for enterprise segment

Key Results:
  - Close 10 enterprise deals ($50K+ ARR each)
  - Achieve 90%+ feature parity with enterprise requirements
  - Get 3 case studies from enterprise customers
```

**SMART Criteria (Alternative):**
```
S = Specific (clear, not vague)
M = Measurable (quantifiable)
A = Achievable (challenging but realistic)
R = Relevant (aligned with company goals)
T = Time-bound (clear deadline)

Example:
  ❌ Bad: "Improve customer satisfaction"
  ✅ Good: "Increase NPS from 45 to 60 by Q4 2024"
```

**Goal Alignment (Company → Team → Individual):**
```
Company OKR:
  Objective: Become the #1 CRM for mid-market SaaS
  KR: $50M ARR by EOY

Sales Team OKR:
  Objective: Scale mid-market sales pipeline
  KR: Generate $80M qualified pipeline
  (supports company KR)

Individual Sales Rep OKR:
  Objective: Close high-value mid-market deals
  KR: Close $2M in new ARR
  (rolls up to team KR)

Alignment:
  Individual success → Team success → Company success
```

**2. CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK (Real-Time Course Correction)**

**The 1:1 Meeting Structure:**

**Frequency:** Weekly or bi-weekly (30-60 min)

**Agenda Template:**
```
[5 min] Personal check-in (How are you?)
  - Build relationship
  - Spot burnout early

[10 min] Updates from team member (their agenda)
  - Progress on goals
  - Blockers
  - Wins to celebrate

[10 min] Feedback from manager
  - What's going well (reinforce)
  - What to improve (coach)
  - Specific examples (not vague)

[5 min] Development discussion
  - Skills to build
  - Stretch opportunities
  - Career progression

[5 min] Action items (clear next steps)
  - Who does what by when
  - Follow up on previous items
```

**Example 1:1:**
```
Manager: "Sarah, in yesterday's client meeting, you handled the pricing objection really well. You stayed calm, anchored on value, and closed the deal. That's exactly the approach we want. Great work."
  → Specific, timely, positive reinforcement

Manager: "One thing to improve: You interrupted the client twice when they were explaining their concerns. Let them finish, then respond. Listening fully shows respect and often they'll answer their own objection."
  → Specific, constructive, actionable

Sarah: "Got it. I was nervous about silence. I'll pause and count to 3 before responding."
  → Commitment to change
```

**SBI Feedback Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact):**
```
S = Situation (when/where)
B = Behavior (what you observed)
I = Impact (effect of behavior)

Example (Positive):
  S: "In this morning's product review..."
  B: "...you presented three options with clear trade-offs..."
  I: "...which helped the team make a fast, confident decision. Great work."

Example (Constructive):
  S: "In yesterday's all-hands..."
  B: "...you checked your phone multiple times during the CEO's update..."
  I: "...which signaled disengagement and distracted others. Let's avoid that."
```

**Radical Candor Framework (Kim Scott):**
```
            Care Personally
                  ↑
                  |
    Ruinous       |      Radical
    Empathy       |      Candor ✓
                  |
    ──────────────┼──────────────→
                  |   Challenge Directly
    Manipulative  |
    Insincerity   |      Obnoxious
                  |      Aggression
```

**Radical Candor = Care Personally + Challenge Directly**
- ✅ "I'm telling you this because I want you to succeed"
- ✅ Direct, honest feedback with empathy
- ✅ Timely (immediately after observation)
- ✅ Private (never public criticism)

**Pitfalls to Avoid:**
```
❌ Ruinous Empathy: Care but don't challenge
   "You're doing great!" (when they're not)
   Result: Person blindsided later

❌ Obnoxious Aggression: Challenge but don't care
   "That was terrible" (harsh, no empathy)
   Result: Person shuts down

❌ Manipulative Insincerity: Neither care nor challenge
   Political, passive-aggressive
   Result: Toxic culture
```

**3. FORMAL REVIEWS (Periodic Calibration)**

**Mid-Year Review (June):**
```
Purpose:
  - Check progress on annual goals
  - Course correct if needed
  - Identify skill gaps
  - Discuss career trajectory

Format:
  - Employee self-assessment
  - Manager assessment
  - 1:1 conversation (60-90 min)
  - Updated goals for H2 (if needed)
```

**Year-End Review (December):**
```
Purpose:
  - Evaluate annual performance
  - Assign rating (if used)
  - Determine compensation changes
  - Set next year's goals

Format:
  - 360-degree feedback (peers, reports, manager)
  - Self-assessment
  - Manager assessment
  - Calibration session (managers align ratings)
  - 1:1 conversation (90 min)
  - Written performance summary
```

**Rating Scale (5-Point):**
```
5 = Exceptional (top 5%)
    - Exceeded all goals significantly
    - Role model for others
    - Transformational impact

4 = Exceeds Expectations (15-20%)
    - Exceeded most goals
    - Consistently high quality
    - Strong impact

3 = Meets Expectations (60-70%)
    - Met all goals
    - Solid contributor
    - Expected performance

2 = Below Expectations (10%)
    - Missed some goals
    - Needs improvement
    - Performance plan required

1 = Unacceptable (bottom 5%)
    - Missed most/all goals
    - Serious performance issues
    - PIP or termination

Distribution:
  - Force ranking or not? (controversial)
  - Most companies target bell curve
  - Avoid grade inflation (everyone is not a 4)
```

**Calibration Session (Managers Align Ratings):**

**Purpose:** Ensure fairness + consistency across teams

**Process:**
```
Step 1: Managers propose ratings
  - Each manager brings their team's ratings
  - With supporting evidence

Step 2: Compare across teams
  - "Jane is a 4 in Sales, Tom is a 4 in Eng"
  - Are they truly equivalent performers?
  - Debate with examples

Step 3: Adjust for consistency
  - Force distribution (if policy)
  - Eliminate manager bias (generous vs. harsh)
  - Document decisions

Step 4: Finalize ratings
  - Lock in ratings
  - Prepare for delivery
```

**Example Calibration:**
```
Sales Manager: "I rated Sarah a 5. She hit 150% of quota."
Eng Manager: "I rated Tom a 5. He shipped 3 major features."
VP: "Both strong, but are they equivalent? Sarah exceeded clear metric by 50%. Tom shipped on time but no outsized impact. Maybe Tom is a 4?"
Eng Manager: "Fair. Adjusted to 4."

Result: Consistent standards across teams
```

**4. DEVELOPMENT (Building Capability)**

**Individual Development Plan (IDP):**

**Structure:**
```
Current State:
  - Strengths (what you're great at)
  - Development areas (gaps to close)

Future State:
  - Career aspiration (where you want to go)
  - Target role (next 1-2 years)
  - Skills needed (gap between current and target)

Action Plan:
  - Learning goals (courses, books, mentorship)
  - Stretch assignments (on-the-job learning)
  - Timeline (milestones)
  - Support needed (budget, time, coaching)
```

**Example IDP: Mid-Level Engineer → Senior Engineer**
```
Current Strengths:
  - Strong coding skills (clean, efficient code)
  - Reliable execution (ships on time)
  - Good team player (collaborative)

Development Areas:
  - System design (lacks experience with large-scale architecture)
  - Leadership (needs to mentor juniors more)
  - Communication (can improve writing/presentations)

Target Role: Senior Engineer (12-18 months)

Skills Needed:
  - Design scalable systems (>1M users)
  - Mentor 2-3 junior engineers
  - Lead cross-functional projects
  - Write technical design docs

Action Plan:
  Q1: Take "System Design" course (Coursera)
  Q2: Lead architecture for new payments service
  Q3: Mentor 2 junior engineers (pair programming)
  Q4: Present architecture review to eng team

Support Needed:
  - $500 course budget
  - 20% time for mentorship
  - Manager coaching on leadership
```

**70-20-10 Learning Model:**
```
70% = On-the-job experience
  - Stretch assignments
  - New projects
  - Cross-functional work
  - Leading initiatives

20% = Learning from others
  - Mentorship
  - Peer feedback
  - Shadowing
  - Conferences

10% = Formal training
  - Courses
  - Books
  - Certifications
  - Workshops

Focus: Most learning happens through doing, not courses
```

#### **PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PLANS (PIPs)**

**When to Use:**
```
✅ Performance below expectations for 2+ months
✅ Specific, documented performance issues
✅ Manager has already provided feedback
✅ Employee aware of expectations (no surprises)
✅ Issues are fixable (skill gap, not culture fit)
```

**PIP Structure (30-60-90 Days):**

```
Step 1: Clearly Define the Problem
  - Specific examples of underperformance
  - Impact on team/company
  - Reference previous feedback

Step 2: Set Clear Expectations
  - What success looks like
  - Measurable goals (OKRs/metrics)
  - Timeline (typically 30-90 days)

Step 3: Provide Support
  - Resources (training, tools)
  - Coaching (weekly 1:1s)
  - Removal of blockers

Step 4: Monitor Progress
  - Weekly check-ins
  - Document improvements (or lack thereof)
  - Adjust plan if needed

Step 5: Outcome Decision
  - Success = off PIP, back to normal
  - Partial success = extend PIP
  - Failure = termination (with severance)
```

**Example PIP: Sales Rep Missing Quota**
```
Problem (30-Day Review):
  - Quota: $100K/month
  - Actual: $45K/month (45% attainment)
  - Pipeline: $200K (should be $400K)
  - Activity: 20 calls/week (should be 50)

Expectations (Next 30 Days):
  - Hit $80K in closed deals (80% quota)
  - Build pipeline to $400K
  - 50 calls/week minimum
  - Complete "Sales Bootcamp" training
  - Manager will shadow 5 calls for coaching

Support Provided:
  - Daily check-ins with manager (15 min)
  - Sales training (2 hours/week)
  - Lead list provided (remove sourcing burden)
  - Adjust territory (remove underperforming accounts)

Week 1 Check-in:
  - 60 calls made ✓ (above target)
  - $50K closed ✓ (on track)
  - Training completed ✓
  - Keep going

Week 4 Outcome:
  - $85K closed ✓ (exceeded target)
  - Pipeline: $420K ✓
  - Off PIP, back to normal
```

**Important:**
- **PIPs are not "performance theater"** (don't use to document termination you've already decided)
- **PIPs should be genuine attempts to help** (provide real support)
- **Most PIPs end in termination** (70-80%) because issues are often deeper than skills

### Common Pitfalls

#### **1. Vague Feedback ("You need to be more strategic")**

**The Trap:** Giving feedback without specifics

**Bad Feedback:**
```
Manager: "You need to be more strategic."
Employee: "Okay... what does that mean?"
Manager: "Just think bigger picture."
Employee: (still confused)

Result: No behavior change
```

**Good Feedback (Specific):**
```
Manager: "In yesterday's roadmap review, you proposed three features but didn't explain how they align with our Q2 revenue goal. Next time, start with the business objective, then show how each feature drives that metric. For example, 'Feature X will reduce churn by 5%, which adds $200K ARR.' That's strategic thinking."

Employee: "Got it. Lead with business impact, not features."

Result: Clear action to take
```

**Principle:** Always include specific examples + desired behavior

#### **2. Recency Bias (Only Remember Last Month)**

**The Trap:** Year-end review focused on recent performance

**Example:**
```
Employee Performance:
  Jan-Oct: Consistently strong (9 months)
  Nov-Dec: One bad project (2 months)

Review: Manager focuses 80% on recent bad project
  "You really dropped the ball on the Nov launch..."

Employee: "What about the 9 months of great work?"
Manager: (forgot)

Result: Unfair evaluation, destroyed morale
```

**Solution: Continuous Documentation**
```
Manager keeps running notes:
  - Jan: Led successful product launch (great work)
  - Mar: Mentored new hire (leadership)
  - Jun: Struggled with database migration (needed more support)
  - Sep: Shipped billing feature on time (solid)
  - Nov: Missed deadline on analytics (issues with clarity)

Year-end: Balanced view of entire year, not just recent
```

**Tool: "Brag Document"**
```
Employee maintains document:
  - Weekly: Log accomplishments
  - Quarterly: Share with manager

Example:
  Q1 Accomplishments:
    - Shipped 5 features (on time)
    - Reduced bugs by 30%
    - Mentored 2 interns
    - Published blog post (10K views)

Benefit: Easy to recall achievements at review time
```

#### **3. Avoiding Difficult Conversations (Ruinous Empathy)**

**The Trap:** Manager avoids giving tough feedback

**Example:**
```
Reality: Employee underperforming for 6 months
Manager's 1:1 conversations: "You're doing great!"

Month 7: Manager delivers bad performance review
Employee: "I had no idea! You said I was doing great!"
Manager: "I didn't want to hurt your feelings..."

Result: Destroyed trust, blindsided employee
```

**Better Approach: Immediate, Honest Feedback**
```
Month 1 (when issue starts):
Manager: "I need to talk about your performance. You missed the deadline on Project X, and the quality had several bugs. This isn't meeting expectations. Let's talk about how to improve."

Employee: (surprised but appreciates honesty)
Manager: "I'm telling you this because I want you to succeed. Let's make a plan."

Month 2-3: Weekly check-ins on improvement
  - Progress? Great, keep going
  - No progress? Escalate to PIP

Result: No surprises, fair process
```

**Principle:** Kindness ≠ Avoiding Hard Conversations. True kindness = honest feedback + support.

#### **4. Grade Inflation ("Everyone is a 4!")**

**The Trap:** Managers rate everyone highly to avoid conflict

**Example:**
```
Manager rates entire team:
  - 5 employees
  - All rated "4 - Exceeds Expectations"

VP: "Really? All 5 are top performers?"
Manager: "I don't want to demotivate anyone..."

Problem:
  - Top performers not distinguished (no incentive)
  - Low performers not identified (no improvement)
  - Ratings meaningless (everyone gets same raise)
```

**Solution: Calibration + Forced Distribution**
```
Policy: Ratings should roughly follow distribution
  5 (Exceptional): 5-10%
  4 (Exceeds): 15-20%
  3 (Meets): 60-70%
  2 (Below): 5-10%
  1 (Unacceptable): 1-5%

Calibration:
  - Managers must defend ratings
  - Compare across teams
  - Adjust for consistency

Result:
  - Ratings have meaning
  - Top performers rewarded
  - Low performers identified
```

**Controversial:** Forced ranking (e.g., GE's "rank and yank" policy)
- Fire bottom 10% annually
- Highly controversial (creates cutthroat culture)
- Most companies abandoned this (Microsoft, GE)
- Better: Clear bar, fire only truly underperforming

#### **5. Development as Afterthought**

**The Trap:** Performance reviews focus only on evaluation, not development

**Example:**
```
Year-End Review (90 min):
  - 80 min: Rating discussion (justify the "3")
  - 5 min: Compensation (2% raise)
  - 5 min: "Any development goals?" (rushed)

Employee: Feels judged, not developed
Manager: Missed opportunity to grow talent

Result: Transactional, not developmental
```

**Better Approach: Development-First Reviews**
```
Year-End Review (90 min):
  - 20 min: Rating (efficient, no surprises because continuous feedback)
  - 10 min: Compensation (fair, transparent)
  - 60 min: Development discussion
    - Career aspirations
    - Skills to build
    - Stretch opportunities next year
    - Support needed

Employee: Feels invested in, excited for growth
Manager: Retains top talent

Result: Development culture
```

### Application Example

#### **Case Study: Adobe's "Check-In" System**

**Adobe's Challenge (2012):**
```
Traditional annual reviews:
  - Managers spent 80,000 hours/year on reviews
  - Employees hated them ("soul-crushing")
  - Didn't improve performance
  - Cost: $20M+ in time

Decision: Kill annual reviews entirely
```

**Adobe's New System: "Check-Ins"**

**Structure:**
```
Continuous Check-Ins (no annual review):
  - Quarterly goal-setting conversations
  - Ongoing feedback (weekly 1:1s)
  - No ratings (no 1-5 scale)
  - Manager decides compensation (with calibration)
```

**Check-In Components:**

**1. Expectations (Quarterly Goals)**
```
Manager + Employee:
  - Set OKRs for quarter
  - Align with company priorities
  - Documented in system

Example:
  Q1 Goals:
    - Ship feature X by March 31
    - Hire 2 engineers
    - Improve team engagement score from 7 to 8
```

**2. Feedback (Ongoing)**
```
Weekly 1:1s:
  - Progress on goals
  - Real-time feedback (specific examples)
  - Course correction

No waiting for annual review
  - If issue, address immediately
  - If success, celebrate immediately
```

**3. Growth & Development (Career Discussion)**
```
Quarterly conversation:
  - Where do you want to go?
  - Skills to build?
  - Opportunities to stretch?

Focus: Future, not just past
```

**Compensation Decision:**
```
No rating, but manager decides:
  - Who gets highest raises (top performers)
  - Who gets standard raises (solid contributors)
  - Who gets no raise (underperformers)

Calibration session ensures fairness across teams
```

**Results (After 3 Years):**
```
✅ 30% reduction in voluntary turnover
   (employees feel more supported)

✅ 80,000 hours saved annually
   (no more review paperwork)

✅ Faster performance improvements
   (immediate feedback vs. annual)

✅ 50% increase in promotion rate
   (development focus)

✅ Higher engagement scores
   (employees feel valued)

Cost savings: $20M+/year
```

**Why It Works:**
- **Continuous > Annual**: Real-time feedback more effective
- **Development > Evaluation**: Growth mindset
- **Simple > Bureaucratic**: Less paperwork, more conversation
- **Trust > Control**: Managers make judgment calls

**Challenges:**
- Requires strong managers (can't rely on forms)
- Some employees miss ratings ("How am I doing?")
- Compensation decisions less transparent (no formula)

**Adobe's Philosophy:** "Feedback should never be a surprise."

#### **Case Study: GE's Failed "Rank and Yank" (Cautionary Tale)**

**GE's System (1980s-2010s):**

**"Vitality Curve" (Jack Welch):**
```
Force-rank all employees:
  - Top 20%: "A Players" (big bonuses, promotions)
  - Middle 70%: "B Players" (standard rewards)
  - Bottom 10%: "C Players" (fire annually)

Philosophy: "Remove bottom 10% every year to improve talent density"
```

**Initial Results (1980s-1990s):**
```
✅ Shareholder value increased (stock price up)
✅ Underperforming managers removed
✅ Performance culture (everyone pushed hard)
✅ Clear differentiation (top performers rewarded)
```

**Long-Term Problems (2000s-2010s):**
```
❌ Cutthroat culture (sabotage peers to avoid bottom 10%)
❌ Short-term thinking (focus on annual rating, not long-term)
❌ Risk-averse behavior (don't try new things = might fail = bottom 10%)
❌ Gaming the system (managers manipulate ratings)
❌ Collaboration killed (competing with teammates)
❌ Lost talent (some "bottom 10%" were still good, just in strong teams)
❌ Legal issues (discrimination lawsuits)
```

**Example Problem: Team Dynamics**
```
High-performing team (all strong):
  - Still must rank someone bottom 10%
  - Good performer gets fired (just because someone has to be last)

Low-performing team (all weak):
  - Top 20% gets big bonus (even if mediocre)
  - Bottom 10% fired, but top 80% stay (still weak)

Result: Penalizes strong teams, rewards weak teams
```

**GE Abandoned System (2015):**
```
New CEO Jeff Immelt:
  "The world is different. Ranking is outdated."

New System:
  - Continuous feedback (no annual rank)
  - Development focus (not forced distribution)
  - Frequent check-ins (like Adobe)

Why:
  - Innovation requires collaboration (rank kills this)
  - Millennials reject rank-and-yank culture
  - Talent is not normally distributed (can have team of all stars)
```

**Lesson: Forced ranking can work short-term (remove deadwood) but long-term destroys culture.**

**Better Alternative:**
- Clear performance bar (fire underperformers, but not quota-based)
- Collaboration over competition
- Development mindset

### Summary

**Modern Performance Management System:**

**1. Continuous, Not Annual**
```
Weekly 1:1s:
  - Progress on goals
  - Real-time feedback (specific examples)
  - Development discussion

Quarterly Check-Ins:
  - Goal refresh (OKRs)
  - Career conversation
  - Course correction

Annual Review:
  - Summary (no surprises)
  - Compensation decision
  - Next year planning
```

**2. Clear Expectations**
```
Goal Setting:
  - Use OKRs or SMART goals
  - Align individual → team → company
  - Measurable outcomes (not activities)

Document:
  - Write down goals
  - Track progress (visible dashboard)
  - Update quarterly
```

**3. Specific, Timely Feedback**
```
Use SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact):
  - Specific examples (not vague)
  - Immediate (not wait for review)
  - Balanced (positive + constructive)

Radical Candor:
  - Care personally + Challenge directly
  - Private criticism, public praise
  - Frequent (not just annual)
```

**4. Fair Evaluation**
```
Calibration:
  - Managers align ratings
  - Consistent standards across teams
  - Evidence-based (not gut feel)

Distribution:
  - Avoid grade inflation (not everyone is "4")
  - Distinguish top performers
  - Address underperformers
```

**5. Development Focus**
```
Individual Development Plan (IDP):
  - Career aspirations
  - Skills to build
  - Stretch assignments
  - Timeline + support

70-20-10 Learning:
  - 70% on-the-job (doing)
  - 20% from others (mentorship)
  - 10% formal training (courses)
```

**Performance Improvement Plans:**
```
Use when:
  - Performance below bar for 2+ months
  - Specific, fixable issues
  - Employee aware (no surprises)

Process:
  - Clear expectations (measurable)
  - Support provided (coaching, resources)
  - Weekly check-ins (monitor progress)
  - 30-90 day timeline
  - Outcome decision (success/extend/terminate)
```

**Key Metrics:**
```
Leading Indicators:
  - 1:1 frequency (weekly = good)
  - Feedback timeliness (days, not months)
  - Goal clarity (% of employees with written OKRs)

Lagging Indicators:
  - Employee engagement scores
  - Voluntary turnover rate (especially top performers)
  - Performance improvement (% hitting goals)
  - Promotion rate (internal development working?)
```

**Red Flags:**
```
🚩 "No surprises" in reviews? (Good)
🚩 Employees blindsided? (Bad - fix immediately)

🚩 Top performers clearly rewarded? (Good)
🚩 Everyone gets same raise? (Bad - grade inflation)

🚩 Development conversations happening? (Good)
🚩 Reviews purely evaluative? (Bad - transactional)

🚩 1:1s happening weekly/bi-weekly? (Good)
🚩 1:1s only when manager initiates? (Bad)

🚩 Underperformers addressed quickly? (Good)
🚩 Underperformers linger for years? (Bad - hurts team)
```

**The Ultimate Test:**

Ask your team:
1. **"Do you know what's expected of you?"** (Goal clarity)
2. **"Do you get regular feedback?"** (Continuous, not annual)
3. **"Do you know where you stand?"** (No surprises)
4. **"Do you feel developed, not just evaluated?"** (Growth mindset)
5. **"Is the system fair?"** (Consistent, evidence-based)

If yes to all 5 = great performance management system
If no to any = fix that component

**Remember:** Performance management is not HR paperwork—it's a continuous system to help people do their best work. Focus on clarity, feedback, fairness, and development.
