  "keyTakeaways": [
    "The European Sales division, led by Marcus Thorne, operates with significant autonomy, reporting directly to the CRO, Liam O'Connell, rather than through a central European managing director.",
    "A potential for conflict exists between the aggressive, revenue-focused Sales organization and the risk-averse Finance & Internal Audit functions, which report up a separate line to the CFO, David Chen.",
    "Critical gatekeeping roles, such as the Manager of Sales Operations (Sophie Dubois), who validates expenses, report directly to the head of the region they are supposed to be monitoring, creating a potential conflict of interest.",
    "The reporting structure is heavily siloed by function at the C-level, which can impede cross-functional communication and create blind spots regarding regional activities that have both sales and financial implications."
