**SUBJECT:** Mandatory Guidance Summary: U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and Global Anti-Bribery Compliance

## Executive Summary

This document provides a summary of the company's Global Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, with a specific focus on compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA is a federal law with broad extraterritorial reach, making it a criminal offense to bribe foreign officials to obtain or retain business. Our corporate policy establishes a zero-tolerance standard for bribery and corruption in any form. Violations carry severe consequences, including multi-million dollar corporate fines, disgorgement of profits, and individual criminal liability resulting in substantial fines and imprisonment. This guide is not a substitute for the full policy but serves as a critical, accessible reference for all employees engaged in international business. Adherence is not optional; it is a condition of employment and a cornerstone of our corporate integrity.

## Background and Scope of the FCPA

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, is a cornerstone of international anti-corruption law. It was enacted to prohibit U.S. persons and businesses, as well as foreign issuers of securities, from making corrupt payments to foreign officials to assist in business dealings. The Act has two primary provisions: the anti-bribery provisions and the accounting provisions.

**Anti-Bribery Provisions:** These provisions prohibit the willful use of any means of interstate commerce (e.g., emails, phone calls, wire transfers) to corruptly offer, pay, promise to pay, or authorize the payment of money or *anything of value* to a *foreign official* for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of that official in their official capacity, or securing any improper advantage, in order to obtain or retain business.

**Accounting Provisions:** These provisions require companies whose securities are listed in the United States to (1) make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the company's transactions and (2) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. These provisions are designed to prevent the falsification of records to conceal illicit payments and ensure management accountability.

This policy and the scope of the FCPA apply globally to all divisions and subsidiaries of the company. It covers all employees (regardless of nationality), officers, directors, as well as third-party agents, consultants, distributors, joint-venture partners, and any other representative acting on the company's behalf. Ignorance of the law or a third party's actions is not a defense; we are liable for the actions of those we engage to represent our interests abroad.

## Key Definitions and Prohibitions

Understanding the broad definitions under the FCPA is critical to compliance. The terms are interpreted expansively by enforcement agencies like the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

**Who is a "Foreign Official"?**
The term is not limited to high-level ministers or elected officials. It includes:
*   Any officer or employee of a foreign government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof.
*   Employees of state-owned or state-controlled enterprises (SOEs). This is a high-risk area, as many of our key customers in telecommunications, energy, and infrastructure sectors in Europe and Asia may be partially or wholly state-owned. A sales director at a state-run utility company is considered a foreign official.
*   Officials of public international organizations (e.g., the United Nations, World Bank).
*   Any person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any such government, department, agency, or organization.
*   Foreign political parties, party officials, or candidates for foreign political office.

**What is "Anything of Value"?**
There is no minimum value threshold for a bribe. "Anything of value" is interpreted broadly and can include, but is not limited to:
*   Cash and cash equivalents.
*   Unreasonable or lavish gifts, travel, hospitality, and entertainment.
*   "Consulting fees" or "commissions" that are disproportionate to the services rendered.
*   Political or charitable contributions made at the request of a foreign official.
*   Discounts on products or services not readily available to the public.
*   Offers of employment or internships for relatives or friends of a foreign official.

The critical element is the *corrupt intent*—the expectation of receiving an improper business advantage in return for the item of value.

## High-Risk Activities and Internal Control Procedures

Certain business activities carry a heightened risk of FCPA violations. Our internal controls are designed to mitigate these risks, and circumvention of these controls is a serious policy violation.

**Gifts, Travel, and Entertainment (Policy 8.3.1)**
While building business relationships is important, providing gifts, travel, and entertainment to foreign officials is a high-risk activity. Company policy strictly limits these expenses.
*   **Gifts:** Must be reasonable in value (under $150 USD equivalent), permissible under local law, and given openly. They must not be in cash.
*   **Travel and Entertainment:** Must be directly related to the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of products or services, or the execution of a contract. All such expenses must be pre-approved in writing by the regional Compliance Director via submission of the "Promotional & Contractual Expense Form (PCEF-EU-22)". Expenses for spouses or family members of officials are strictly prohibited. "Per diem" payments to officials that exceed documented, reasonable costs are also prohibited. All approved expenses must be meticulously documented in the Concur expense system with corresponding receipts and business justifications. Expense reports with vague descriptions such as "Client Entertainment" or "Local Partner Support" will be rejected and escalated.

**Third-Party Intermediaries (Policy 4.5.2)**
The vast majority of FCPA enforcement actions involve payments made through third-party agents, consultants, or local partners. The company is strictly liable for their actions. Therefore, an extensive due diligence process is mandatory before engaging any third party that will interact with government officials on our behalf.
*   **Due Diligence:** A formal background check, conducted by the Legal department, is required.
*   **Written Agreement:** A written contract is mandatory, which must include specific anti-corruption representations, warranties, and audit rights.
*   **Red Flags:** Immediately report any of the following to Compliance:
    *   The third party is recommended by a government official.
    *   Requests for unusually high commissions or fees, or requests for payment in cash or to an offshore account in a different country.
    *   The party has a reputation for corruption or lacks experience in the relevant field.
    *   Refusal to provide detailed invoices or documentation for expenses.

## Accounting "Books and Records" Provisions

The FCPA's accounting provisions are a separate but equally important area of compliance. Every expense must be recorded accurately. Bribes are often disguised on corporate books as legitimate business expenses. Mischaracterizing a payment is a violation of the FCPA, regardless of whether the underlying bribe is ever proven.
*   **Accurate Classification:** All payments must be accurately described and recorded in the company's financial systems. Classifying a corrupt payment as a "commission," "consulting fee," "marketing expense," or "miscellaneous cost" is a violation of federal law.
*   **No Off-the-Books Accounts:** The use of undisclosed or unrecorded corporate funds or assets for any purpose is strictly forbidden.
*   **Internal Controls:** All employees must comply with the company's system of internal controls. This includes obtaining necessary approvals for expenditures, providing accurate documentation, and never creating misleading or false records. For example, submitting a reimbursement request for an "internal team dinner" that was actually used to entertain a foreign official is a serious violation.

## Reporting Obligations and Consequences of Violation

Every employee has a duty to report any suspected violation of this policy or the FCPA. The company is committed to a non-retaliation policy, meaning no adverse action will be taken against any employee for making a good-faith report of a potential violation.

**Reporting Channels:**
1.  Immediate Supervisor or Manager
2.  The Legal Department or the Chief Compliance Officer
3.  The company's anonymous, 24/7 Global Ethics & Compliance Hotline

**Consequences of Non-Compliance:**
The penalties for violating the FCPA are severe and apply to both the corporation and the individuals involved.
*   **For the Company:** Corporate fines can exceed $2 million per anti-bribery violation and $25 million per accounting violation. Furthermore, the company may be required to disgorge all profits earned from the corruptly obtained business.
*   **For Individuals:** Employees, officers, and directors face criminal prosecution, with penalties of up to 5 years in prison and personal fines of up to $250,000 per violation. The company is prohibited by law from indemnifying or reimbursing individuals for fines levied for FCPA violations.

Our commitment to ethical conduct is absolute. We will achieve our business goals through superior technology and service, not through corruption. Your full and active compliance with the FCPA and our global anti-bribery policies is mandatory. Annual certification of your understanding and adherence to these principles is required.
