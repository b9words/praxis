# INTERNAL MEMORANDUM

**TO:** Chair, Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
**FROM:** Anika Sharma, General Counsel
**DATE:** October 26, 2023
**SUBJECT:** Preliminary Findings from Forensic E-Discovery Review: Julian Thorne Communications (Project Nightingale)

## Executive Summary

This memorandum provides a preliminary summary of findings from the forensic e-discovery review of email communications belonging to Mr. Julian Thorne, Head of Sales, EMEA, for the period of October 1, 2022, to September 30, 2023. The review was initiated in response to the anonymous whistleblower allegation received on October 20, 2023. Our initial analysis has identified a pattern of highly concerning communications, undocumented payments to third-party "consultants," and a clear temporal correlation between these activities and the successful acquisition of several large public sector contracts, particularly in France and Italy. The communications suggest a deliberate effort to circumvent standard company expense and vendor approval policies through the use of vaguely defined "Market Development Funds" (MDF) and "Local Partner Facilitation Fees." While no email contains an explicit admission of bribery, the language, timing, and financial correlations strongly suggest improper and potentially illegal activities intended to influence foreign officials.

## Background and Scope of Review

Following the receipt of a credible whistleblower complaint alleging bribery and corruption within our EMEA sales division, the Office of the General Counsel, in coordination with external counsel at Sullivan & Cromwell, initiated "Project Nightingale." The project's initial phase involves a discreet forensic review of all electronic communications and financial records associated with Mr. Thorne and his direct reports.

The scope of this initial e-discovery phase was limited to the archived email inbox of Julian Thorne, covering the trailing twelve months. The primary objective was to identify any communications that could substantiate or refute the whistleblower's claims regarding improper payments to secure public contracts. The review team utilized a set of 52 keyword search terms, including but not limited to: "facilitation," "special payment," "local partner," "unblock," "grease the wheels," "success fee," "commission," as well as the names of specific government entities and recently won contracts. Over 15,000 emails were initially flagged, which were then manually reviewed by a team of three forensic attorneys to identify the approximately 85 emails of high relevance detailed in this analysis. This memo focuses on the most critical communications that establish a pattern of behavior and a timeline of concern.

## Chronological Analysis of Key Communications

The communications reveal a distinct pattern that escalates over the fiscal year. The exchanges center around two major contract pursuits: the "Project Danube" tender with a French municipal water authority and the "Helios Initiative" with an Italian national energy provider.

**Q4 2022: Initial Frustrations and the Introduction of "Consultants"**

*   **November 5, 2022 (Email from Thorne to EMEA CFO):** Thorne expresses significant frustration with "bureaucratic roadblocks" on the Project Danube tender. He states, "We are technically superior, but we are failing to navigate the local political landscape. Standard T&E and marketing budgets are insufficient for the kind of relationship-building required here."
*   **November 18, 2022 (Email from Thorne to a personal Gmail address, subject: "Parisian dinner"):** "Met with our friend. The path forward is clearer but will require a significant 'success fee' to be paid to his nominated consulting firm, 'Vanguard Solutions.' He was clear that without their 'strategic guidance,' the technical committee will not grant approval. This is non-negotiable."
*   **December 2, 2022 (Email from Thorne to his direct report, Head of Sales, France):** "We need to process the Vanguard Solutions invoice immediately. Code it to the Q4 Market Development Fund. Let's list the services as 'Competitive Landscape and Regulatory Analysis.' Make sure the description is broad. We need this cleared before the 15th."

**Q2 2023: The "Helios Initiative" and Escalating Payments**

*   **April 12, 2023 (Email from Thorne to CEO, David Chen):** In a weekly update, Thorne notes extreme progress on the Helios Initiative in Italy, which had been stalled for six months. He writes, "We have finally found the right local partners to help us unlock the potential in Rome. I've taken a more aggressive, entrepreneurial approach to unblocking the regulatory hurdles, and it's paying dividends. Expect good news soon."
*   **April 19, 2023 (Email chain between Thorne and an external contact, 'mario.rossi@consult-italia.com'):** Rossi writes, "The committee requires further assurances. The 'logistical support fee' we discussed needs to be increased by 25% to account for additional stakeholders." Thorne replies from his phone less than 10 minutes later: "Understood. Unacceptable, but understood. I will authorize the revised amount. You must guarantee the outcome. No more delays."
*   **May 4, 2023 (Email from Thorne to EMEA Controller):** "Please approve the attached SOW for 'Consult-Italia S.R.L.' for €250,000. This is for urgent strategic market entry advisory for the Helios bid. This is a critical time-sensitive payment." The controller replies questioning the lack of detail and vendor history, to which Thorne responds: "This is a CEO-priority initiative. The vendor was sourced via my executive network and is essential to our success. Please process."

## Detailed Findings and Areas of Concern

The review of Mr. Thorne's communications has surfaced several critical areas of concern that align directly with the whistleblower allegations. These findings suggest a deliberate and systematic effort to use third-party intermediaries to make questionable payments for the purpose of influencing contract awards.

1.  **Use of Opaque Third-Party Intermediaries:** Mr. Thorne consistently engaged small, newly-formed consulting entities with vague service descriptions (e.g., "Vanguard Solutions," "Consult-Italia S.R.L."). Our preliminary due diligence shows these firms have minimal public presence, no other discernible clients, and were established shortly before being engaged by our company. Their invoices, cross-referenced with expense reports, contain generic descriptions like "Strategic Advisory Services" or "Regulatory Environment Analysis" for lump-sum payments ranging from €75,000 to €250,000.

2.  **Coded and Circumstantial Language:** The emails avoid explicit terms like "bribe" or "payoff." However, the consistent use of phrases such as "greasing the wheels," "unblocking the path," "success fee," and "ensuring our friends are taken care of" in the context of large, poorly documented payments is highly indicative of corrupt intent. In one email from February 2023, Thorne instructs a subordinate to "make sure Mr. Dubois's 'conference sponsorship' is handled personally and discreetly" just days before a key technical specification for a tender was modified in our favor. Mr. Dubois is a mid-level official in the French municipal authority.

3.  **Circumvention of Internal Controls:** There is clear evidence of Mr. Thorne pressuring finance and controller-level staff to approve payments that fall outside of standard procedure. He frequently invokes "CEO-level priority" or "time-sensitive business needs" to bypass requests for detailed justification, competitive bids for consulting services, or proper vendor onboarding. The Market Development Fund (MDF) appears to have been used as a slush fund for these payments, with expenditures bearing little resemblance to legitimate marketing activities.

## Correlation with Financial Data

A preliminary cross-referencing of the email timeline with sales and expense data reveals a deeply troubling correlation.

*   The payment of €150,000 to "Vanguard Solutions" on December 16, 2022, was followed by our notification on January 20, 2023, that we had won Phase 1 of the Project Danube contract, valued at €12 million. This was an unexpected win, as internal forecasts had placed our probability of success at less than 20%.
*   The payment of €250,000 to "Consult-Italia S.R.L." on May 5, 2023, preceded the award of the Helios Initiative contract on June 1, 2023. This €28 million contract was the largest in the division's history. The email chain shows Thorne explicitly linking the payment to a "guaranteed outcome."
*   Total payments to these two "consulting" firms in FY2023 amount to €725,000, all categorized under the EMEA MDF budget. This represents a 450% increase in the use of single-source consulting vendors compared to the prior fiscal year.

## Preliminary Recommendations

These findings are severe and require immediate, decisive action to mitigate legal, financial, and reputational risk. Based on this initial review, I strongly recommend the following next steps for the Audit Committee's consideration:

1.  **Immediate Suspension:** Place Mr. Julian Thorne on administrative leave, effective immediately, pending the outcome of a full investigation. This is necessary to preserve the integrity of the investigation and prevent any potential destruction of evidence or witness tampering.
2.  **Expand Investigation:** Authorize the expansion of Project Nightingale to include a full forensic audit of the entire EMEA sales division's expense reports, vendor payments, and MDF usage for the past three years. The e-discovery scope should be expanded to include Mr. Thorne's direct reports.
3.  **Board Notification & Potential Disclosure:** Prepare a confidential briefing for the full Board of Directors. We must also begin preparing a draft voluntary disclosure to the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under the FCPA Corporate Enforcement Policy. Acting swiftly and transparently is our best course of action to mitigate potential penalties.
4.  **Engage External Forensic Accountants:** Retain a firm such as Deloitte or PwC with expertise in FCPA investigations to conduct the full forensic accounting audit. This will ensure independence and provide the necessary credibility for our internal investigation.

This situation represents a significant governance failure and a material risk to the company. We must act with urgency and diligence. My office is prepared to execute on these recommendations upon the Committee's approval.
