**SUBJECT:** URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL: Allegations of Systemic Bribery and FCPA Violations in European Sales Division

## Executive Summary

This submission is made with the utmost concern for the integrity and legal standing of our company. I have direct and credible evidence of a widespread and systemic bribery scheme being orchestrated by Jean-Pierre Dubois, President of European Sales, to secure large-scale government and quasi-public contracts. This scheme involves channeling illicit payments, often disguised as "consulting fees" or "marketing expenses," through a network of shell or pass-through entities in several EU countries. These actions represent a flagrant violation of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the UK Bribery Act, and local anti-corruption laws, exposing the company to catastrophic legal, financial, and reputational damage. The total value of contracts won under these suspect conditions in the last 24 months exceeds €150 million. I implore the Audit Committee to launch an immediate, independent investigation before evidence is destroyed and the company's exposure deepens.

## Background and Context

I am a senior employee with several years of experience in a role that provides me with detailed visibility into the financial operations, contract approvals, and expense reporting within the EMEA theatre. Over the past three years, since Mr. Dubois assumed leadership, the culture in the European sales division has shifted from a focus on product value and competitive excellence to a "win at all costs" mentality. Pressure to meet increasingly aggressive quarterly targets, set personally by Dubois, has become immense. While on the surface, the European division has been celebrated for its spectacular growth and landmark contract wins, a closer look at the underlying data reveals a disturbing pattern that cannot be explained by legitimate business practices. We have suddenly begun winning highly competitive public tenders against entrenched local incumbents in markets where we previously struggled to gain traction. These improbable wins are consistently preceded by the engagement of obscure, high-cost "local consultants" who appear to provide no discernible, legitimate service to the company.

The internal narrative, championed by Dubois, is that his team has "cracked the code" on navigating complex European procurement bureaucracies. However, the financial evidence points to a much darker reality. The process is almost always the same: a major public tender is announced, our bid is initially viewed as a long shot, a new "consulting partner" is onboarded with minimal due diligence and an opaque scope of work, a significant upfront payment is processed, and shortly thereafter, the contract is awarded to us against all odds. These consulting firms have no public profile, no track record, and are often newly incorporated entities. Their invoices are invariably vague, citing "strategic advisory services," "market access facilitation," or "regulatory compliance support," yet their fees can amount to as much as 5-8% of the total contract value, a figure that is commercially unjustifiable for the services allegedly rendered.

## Current Situation and Analysis

The scheme's primary mechanism is the abuse of the Vendor Management and Accounts Payable systems. Mr. Dubois and a small circle of trusted subordinates, including Didier Rousseau (Regional Director, Southern Europe) and Eva Schmidt (Head of Bids & Proposals), appear to be the primary architects. They identify and engage these "consultants." The vendor onboarding process is often expedited under the guise of "urgent business need," bypassing standard due diligence protocols. The invoices, typically ranging from €250,000 to over €1.5 million, are coded to generic marketing or professional services GL accounts, which are conveniently part of Dubois's discretionary budget, thus avoiding heightened scrutiny from corporate finance.

An analysis of T&E reports for Dubois's team further corroborates these concerns. Expense reports frequently feature lavish entertainment expenses for individuals identified only as "local government advisors" or "ministry consultants"—individuals who do not appear in our Salesforce CRM or any official meeting logs. For example, a single dinner in Brussels expensed by Mr. Rousseau in April 2023 cost over €8,500 for four attendees, one of whom was listed as a "local infrastructure consultant" who we later learned is the brother-in-law of a key official in the Belgian Ministry of Transport. This is not an isolated incident but part of a consistent pattern of off-the-books influence peddling. The frequency and cost of these activities spike dramatically in the 6-8 weeks prior to the award of a major contract.

## Key Findings and Issues

I have compiled several specific examples where this pattern is undeniable. The evidence resides within the company's own SAP financial system, Concur expense platform, and email servers.

1.  **Project Helios (Spain, Q2 2022):** We were awarded a €45 million contract for a national solar energy grid modernization. This was a surprise win, as we were bidding against a state-backed Spanish utility. Financial records show that three months prior, we engaged a firm called "Soluciones Energéticas Avanzadas S.L." for a "market feasibility study." This firm was incorporated only two weeks before we engaged them. We paid them a total of €2.2 million in two tranches. A review of Dubois’s emails from that period contains a message to Rousseau with the subject "Helios Sunshine," stating, "Our friends at SEA are confident the clouds will part. Ensure their initial invoice is processed by EOW." There is no final report or tangible deliverable from this firm in our system.

2.  **Berlin U-Bahn Modernization (Germany, Q4 2022):** A €33 million contract to upgrade the signaling system. Our technical proposal was initially ranked third. We then engaged "Berliner Brücken Consulting GmbH" for €1.1 million for "local partner integration services." An internal search reveals this firm is owned by a former high-ranking city transport official. After their engagement, a key technical requirement in the tender was unexpectedly amended, favoring our specific technology. Eva Schmidt's expense reports from this period show multiple "working lunches" at exclusive Berlin clubs with individuals from this consulting firm and officials from the transit authority.

3.  **French Digital Health Initiative (France, Q3 2023):** We recently won a €72 million national contract, our largest European public-sector win to date. This followed payments totaling over €3.5 million to a Paris-based firm, "Patrimoine Conseil & Stratégie." The justification for their fee was "stakeholder alignment and public-private partnership structuring." This firm's registered address is a residential apartment. More alarmingly, a wire transfer confirmation shows that a portion of our payment to them was subsequently transferred to a separate entity in Switzerland, a known tactic for obscuring the final destination of funds.

## Recommendations and Next Steps

The evidence is overwhelming, and the risk of inaction is immense. A discovery by regulators would be devastating. I strongly urge the Audit Committee to take the following immediate steps:

1.  **Engage External Counsel:** Immediately retain an independent law firm with deep expertise in FCPA and international corruption investigations. Internal counsel may have conflicts or be too close to the individuals involved.
2.  **Forensic Accounting Audit:** Commission a "clean room" forensic audit of the European division's financials for the past 36 months, focusing on all payments to third-party consultants, marketing agencies, and professional services firms. The audit must scrutinize vendor onboarding, invoice justification, and payment approvals.
3.  **Preserve Evidence:** Issue a broad, non-specific document preservation order for the entire European leadership team, including emails, text messages, and collaboration platform data (e.g., Teams, Slack). It is critical to secure this data before Mr. Dubois or others become aware of an investigation and attempt to destroy evidence.
4.  **Suspend Key Individuals:** Consider placing Jean-Pierre Dubois, Didier Rousseau, and Eva Schmidt on administrative leave pending the investigation's outcome to prevent further illicit activity and ensure the integrity of the investigation.
5.  **Prepare for Disclosure:** The external counsel should begin preparing a strategy for potential voluntary disclosure to the Department of Justice and the SEC. Early and full cooperation is often critical in mitigating penalties.

## Conclusion

I am bringing this to your attention because I believe in this company and what it stands for, and I cannot stand by while its reputation and future are jeopardized by the reckless and illegal actions of a few individuals. The behavior I have witnessed is not just a policy violation; it is a criminal conspiracy that could result in massive fines, debarment from public contracts, and even imprisonment for the executives involved. The culture of fear and intimidation instilled by Mr. Dubois prevents others from speaking up, which is why I have chosen this anonymous channel. I have placed my trust in the Board to act decisively and discreetly to protect the company, its employees, and its shareholders. Please, you must act now. The paper trail is all there if you know where to look.
