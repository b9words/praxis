## Our Unprecedented Opportunity

We now own the #1 and #3 products in the Enterprise Workflow Automation space: **LegacySuite** and **FlowState**.

*   **LegacySuite:**
    *   65% market share in Fortune 500.
    *   Renowned for security (SOC-2, HIPAA) and stability.
    *   Represents our core enterprise revenue.

*   **FlowState:**
    *   Dominant in the mid-market and high-growth tech sectors.
    *   Loved for its user-friendly UI and rapid iteration cycle.
    *   Represents our key growth vector.

Instead of competing, we can combine our strengths to create an unassailable market leader.

## The Vision: A "Best of Both" Platform

### Introducing "Synergy"

A single, next-generation platform that merges the robust, enterprise-grade architecture of LegacySuite with the intuitive, agile interface of FlowState.

*   **No more compromises for our customers.** They get enterprise power with consumer-grade usability.
*   **No more divided R&D efforts for us.** All 120 engineers focused on a single codebase.
*   **One platform to rule the entire market,** from SMB to the Global 2000.

This is the only path to realizing the full value of the acquisition.

## Core Feature Integration Pillars

### Merging Strengths: The Synergy Feature Set

*   **Pillar 1: Unified Core Engine**
    *   Port FlowState's flexible rules engine onto LegacySuite's hardened, multi-tenant infrastructure. This will provide the ultimate combination of speed and security.

*   **Pillar 2: Seamless UI/UX**
    *   Develop a new, unified design system incorporating FlowState's award-winning UX patterns. We will maintain the "feel" of FlowState while ensuring enterprise-grade data density.

*   **Pillar 3: Consolidated Data Model**
    *   Create a new, extensible data schema to support all current and future use cases from both platforms, eliminating data silos forever.

*   **Pillar 4: Integrated API Gateway**
    *   A single API endpoint for all customers, providing backward compatibility for ~90% of existing integrations.

## Next Steps & Resource Ask

### Securing Our Future

We are requesting full executive sign-off on the Project Unify roadmap and vision.
