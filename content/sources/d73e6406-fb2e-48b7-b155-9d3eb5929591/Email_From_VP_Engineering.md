**TO:** Executive Leadership Council (ELC)
**FROM:** Anya Sharma, VP Engineering

**SUBJECT:** URGENT: Engineering Division Analysis & Strategic Recommendations on Mandated 15% Headcount Reduction

### Executive Summary

This memorandum provides the Engineering Division's formal analysis regarding the mandated 15% headcount reduction. While we fully understand the financial exigencies driving this difficult decision, a simplistic, performance-based, or uniform cut will inflict catastrophic and potentially irreversible damage on our product roadmap and long-term technical viability. A reduction of 15 full-time employees (FTEs) from our division of 100 must be executed with surgical precision. This document outlines a proposed framework that prioritizes the preservation of critical skills, protects future revenue streams, and minimizes operational disruption. Our core recommendation is to shift from a performance-score-centric model to a skills-based retention strategy, ring-fencing our most critical strategic initiatives (Project Orion and the Helios Platform team) and focusing reductions on areas with skill redundancy or misalignment with our future technology stack. Executing this poorly will cost us more in lost opportunity and recovery efforts than the short-term salary savings it generates.

### Background and Context

The current market downturn and the resulting directive to reduce operating expenses by 15% across the board are well understood. The Engineering Division, currently staffed at 100 FTEs with an annual payroll budget of $18.5M, is tasked with identifying 15 individuals for separation. This action follows a six-month hiring freeze and a 25% reduction in our contractor and vendor budgets, measures which have already stretched our teams thin.

Our division is currently structured around four key pillars:
1.  **Core Product Engineering (45 FTEs):** Responsible for maintaining and developing our flagship revenue-generating products, including the "Momentum" suite.
2.  **Platform & Infrastructure (20 FTEs):** Manages our cloud infrastructure, data pipelines, and security. This team is leading the critical, multi-year "Helios" cloud migration project.
3.  **Advanced R&D / "Project Orion" (12 FTEs):** Our strategic bet on the next generation of our platform. This is a pre-revenue, skunkworks-style team composed of our most innovative senior talent.
4.  **Quality & DevOps (23 FTEs):** Includes Quality Assurance, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE), and internal tooling.

The mandate comes at a precarious time. The Helios migration is at a crucial midpoint, with a target completion of Q3 2024. Project Orion is scheduled for its first internal alpha release in Q1 2024, a key milestone for securing next-round funding and future market positioning. Any disruption to these two initiatives, in particular, will have outsized negative consequences that ripple across the entire organization for years to come.

### Current Situation and Analysis

A preliminary analysis of the divisional roster against performance review data reveals significant, dangerous complexities. A naive approach of cutting the bottom 15% of performers (based on our 1-5 rating scale) would result in a devastating loss of institutional knowledge and create several single points of failure.

Of the 18 employees currently rated as "2 - Needs Improvement," seven are concentrated in the Core Product Engineering team responsible for our legacy "Momentum G1" platform. This platform, while technically dated, still generates approximately 40% of our annual recurring revenue. These seven engineers possess a unique and poorly documented skillset in a deprecated programming language that is essential for maintaining service for our largest enterprise clients. The estimated time to train new engineers on this system is 9-12 months, a delay our key accounts will not tolerate. Losing even three of these individuals could trigger service degradation and put major renewals at risk.

Conversely, the Project Orion team consists exclusively of engineers rated "5 - Exceeds Expectations" or "4 - High Performer." Their compensation is, on average, 20% higher than the divisional median. While cutting from this team would yield greater short-term savings, it would effectively cripple our primary engine for future growth. The competitive landscape for Orion's target market is fierce; a 6-month delay caused by losing 2-3 key architects would mean ceding first-mover advantage, a strategic blunder from which we may not recover. The team's work is so specialized that backfilling these roles would be nearly impossible in the current climate.

### Key Findings and Critical Issues

Further analysis reveals four primary issues that must be addressed to ensure a successful, albeit painful, reduction in force.

**1. The Performance Score Fallacy:** Our current performance management system is optimized for recognizing growth and innovation, not for identifying "survivable" roles in a downturn. It systematically undervalues engineers in maintenance roles on stable, legacy systems. As noted, the "Momentum G1" team is a prime example. These engineers are not our future leaders, but they are the bedrock of our current revenue. Their lower scores reflect the lack of "high-impact" project work available to them, not a lack of value.

**2. The Hidden Cost of Severing "Connective Tissue":** Our roster includes approximately 30-35 mid-level engineers with "3 - Meets Expectations" ratings. These individuals are not superstars, but they are the workhorses of the division. They possess deep cross-functional knowledge, mentor our junior talent, and handle the unglamorous but essential work of bug fixes, testing, and on-call rotations. A reduction that disproportionately targets this cohort to protect top performers would lead to a "barbell" organization of senior architects and junior coders with no one in between to execute, mentor, and manage daily operations. This would inevitably lead to burnout among the remaining senior staff and a decline in code quality.

**3. Single Points of Failure (SPOFs):** A detailed skills audit reveals at least five critical SPOFs within the division. For example, a single database administrator manages the entire data architecture for our core product. One SRE engineer is the only person with the expertise to manage our CI/CD pipeline. While some of these individuals are high performers, two are not. The decision-making process must explicitly map and protect against decapitating these unique, mission-critical functions, regardless of the individual's most recent performance score.

**4. The Morale and Productivity Cliff:** The human impact cannot be overstated. An improperly handled layoff will crush the morale of the remaining 85 employees. If the process is perceived as arbitrary, unfair, or ignorant of technical realities, it will trigger a wave of voluntary attrition among our best people, who will have no trouble finding new roles. The message we send with *who* we cut is as important as the act of cutting itself. A strategic, skill-based cut, while still painful, can be communicated as a necessary move to protect the company's future. A performance-based cut will be seen as a betrayal of loyal, long-serving employees.

### Recommendations and Next Steps

To mitigate the risks outlined above, I strongly recommend against a uniform or performance-score-based approach. I propose the following strategic framework for this reduction:

**1. Adopt a Skills-Based Prioritization Matrix:** We must immediately develop a retention matrix that ranks employees based on criteria weighted towards future needs and current stability. I suggest the following weights:
    *   **40%:** Skill alignment with future strategic roadmaps (Orion & Helios).
    *   **30%:** Criticality to maintaining current revenue-generating systems.
    *   **20%:** Individual performance and potential.
    *   **10%:** Institutional knowledge and mentorship capabilities.

**2. Formally Ring-Fence "Project Orion" and "Helios Platform" Teams:** I request formal ELC approval to exempt the 12 members of Project Orion and the 8 core members of the Helios Platform team from this RIF. This is non-negotiable for the division's future. This means the 15-person cut must be absorbed by the remaining 80 employees, increasing the effective cut rate in those departments to 18.75%. This is a difficult tradeoff, but a necessary one to protect our future.

**3. Consolidate and Eliminate Redundant Roles:** The skills matrix will highlight areas of skill overlap, particularly in front-end development and generalist QA testing. The reductions should be focused here first, allowing us to preserve unique specialists.

**4. Prepare a Comprehensive Communication Plan:** For those remaining, we must be prepared to immediately communicate a clear vision for the future, reaffirm our commitment to our strategic projects, and explain the logic behind the new, leaner organizational structure. I will personally lead town halls with the entire division to address concerns directly.

### Conclusion

The coming weeks will be among the most challenging in our company's history. The mandate to reduce headcount by 15% is a painful necessity. However, executing this mandate without a deeply considered, strategic framework will lead to a pyrrhic victory—we will hit our short-term financial target at the cost of our long-term ability to compete and innovate. The Engineering Division is prepared to make the necessary sacrifices, but these sacrifices must be strategic. They must be made with an eye toward the future, ensuring that the team that remains is the one best equipped to carry us forward. I urge the council to approve the proposed skills-based framework and the ring-fencing of our most critical projects. I am available to discuss this analysis and my recommendations at your earliest convenience.
