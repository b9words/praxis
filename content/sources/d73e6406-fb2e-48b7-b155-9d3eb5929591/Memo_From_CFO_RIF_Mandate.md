**INTERNAL MEMORANDUM**

**TO:** All Divisional VPs & Department Heads
**FROM:** Alistair Finch, Chief Financial Officer
**DATE:** October 17, 2023
**SUBJECT:** URGENT: Mandated OpEx Realignment and Headcount Reduction

## Executive Summary

This memorandum outlines an immediate and non-negotiable directive to realign our operational expenditures in response to severe macroeconomic headwinds and their direct impact on our Q3 performance. Despite proactive cost-containment measures, our current expense structure, particularly personnel costs, is unsustainable given the revised revenue outlook for the next 18 months. Consequently, the Executive Committee, with full support from the Board of Directors, has mandated a company-wide Reduction in Force (RIF). Effective immediately, each division is required to reduce its total headcount by 15%. This difficult action is a financial and strategic necessity to ensure the long-term viability and health of the company. Your full cooperation and swift, thoughtful execution are paramount.

## Background: Unpacking the Current Macroeconomic Headwinds

As a leadership team, we have been transparent about the challenging market conditions developing since Q2. The confluence of persistent inflation, aggressive interest rate hikes by central banks globally, and a marked slowdown in enterprise capital spending has created a perfect storm. Our primary markets, particularly in North America and the EU, are showing clear signs of contraction. The most recent industry-wide forecasts from Gartner and Forrester have revised enterprise IT spending growth for 2024 down from a projected 8.1% to a mere 1.5%, with a significant risk of a negative print.

We are not immune to these external forces. Major competitors, including Veridian Dynamics and OmniCorp, have already announced RIFs of 10% and 12% respectively, signaling a broad-based industry correction. Customer purchasing cycles have elongated, with new deals requiring multiple layers of senior executive approval, and we have seen a 30% increase in deal postponements in the last quarter alone. The capital markets have reacted harshly to this new reality; our stock is down 35% year-to-date, underperforming the NASDAQ Composite by 12 percentage points. The investment community's focus has shifted entirely from growth-at-all-costs to a clear and defensible path to profitability and positive free cash flow. We must adapt to this new paradigm or risk more severe consequences.

## Current Situation: A Review of Our Q3 Financial Performance

Our preliminary Q3 results confirm the severity of the situation. We are forecasting top-line revenue of approximately $410 million, a staggering 18% miss against our $500 million target and a 5% decline year-over-year. This is the first YoY revenue decline in the company's history. The downstream impact on profitability has been immediate and acute. Our adjusted EBITDA margin has compressed from a healthy 22% in Q3 of last year to an estimated 14% this quarter. More alarmingly, we are projecting our first quarter of negative free cash flow in over three years.

Our operational expense structure was built for a different economic environment. Total operating expenses for Q3 are tracking at $352 million, with personnel costs (salaries, benefits, taxes, and stock-based compensation) accounting for 65% of that total. While we have already instituted a hiring freeze, eliminated non-essential travel, and are aggressively renegotiating all major vendor contracts, these measures are insufficient. They are projected to yield only $4-5 million in annualized savings, a fraction of what is required to right-size the business. To be blunt, there is no path to restoring financial stability without addressing our largest expense line: our headcount.

## Financial Imperatives & Operational Mandate

The Board of Directors held an emergency session last week to review these preliminary results and unanimously endorsed a plan to restore the company to a sound financial footing. The primary directive is to achieve a sustainable, run-rate OpEx reduction of $22 million by the end of Q1 2024. This target is designed to bring our cost structure in line with the new revenue reality and ensure we can generate positive cash flow throughout the anticipated 12-18 month downturn.

After extensive modeling, it is clear that we cannot reach this target through attrition or non-headcount-related cuts alone. We must therefore undertake a Reduction in Force. The mandate is a flat 15% headcount reduction across every division. There will be no exceptions. This is a difficult, but mathematically necessary, decision. We understand that this is a blunt instrument, but a uniform, company-wide approach is the only way to ensure the cuts are executed quickly and equitably, preventing a prolonged period of uncertainty and organizational paralysis. Your task as leaders is to execute this mandate within your divisions with strategic precision.

## Guiding Principles for the Reduction in Force (RIF)

It is critically important to understand that this is **not** a performance-based exercise. We will be losing good people, and this is not a reflection of their contributions. The objective is to reshape our organization to be leaner, more agile, and focused on the core capabilities required to win in the future. As you determine the composition of your reduction list, you must adhere to the following principles:

1.  **Preserve Critical Skills for the Future:** Your primary filter should not be "who are the lowest performers?" but rather "which skills and roles are indispensable for our 2025 strategy?" Identify talent with expertise in our growth areas, such as AI/ML application, cloud-native architecture, and data analytics. Protect individuals with deep institutional knowledge of our core platforms and key customer relationships. The goal is to exit the downturn with our most critical capabilities intact and strengthened.

2.  **Minimize Operational Disruption:** Analyze your organizational chart for single points of failure. The RIF should not cripple mission-critical projects or create knowledge gaps that will take months to fill. You must assess the immediate impact of each proposed departure on current workflows, product roadmaps, and client deliverables. Thoughtful consolidation of responsibilities will be key.

3.  **Evaluate Role Redundancy and Hierarchy:** This is an opportunity to streamline your organization. Look for layers of management that can be flattened and areas with overlapping responsibilities. Prioritize retaining "player-coach" roles over pure administrative management where possible. Focus on retaining individuals who have demonstrated versatility and the ability to operate effectively across multiple functions.

HR will provide a legal and procedural framework to ensure a consistent and compliant process. However, the strategic decisions of who stays and who goes rest entirely with you. Your justification for each decision must be rooted in this strategic logic.

## Directive and Next Steps

The timeline for this process is extremely compressed to minimize disruption and anxiety across the organization. The following are your immediate action items and deadlines:

1.  **Final Roster Submission:** You must submit your final list of impacted employees for your division (equaling exactly 15% of your current headcount) to the Executive Committee.
2.  **Justification Memorandum:** Accompanying the list, you must provide a memorandum addressed to the CEO and CHRO. This document must detail the strategic rationale for your selections, explaining how your final roster preserves the most critical skills and aligns with the guiding principles outlined above.
3.  **Deadline:** Both the final list and the justification memo are due for review by **EOD, Friday, October 28th.**

This entire process is to be held in the strictest confidence. Any breach of confidentiality will have severe consequences and will undermine the integrity of this difficult but necessary process. All inquiries from your teams should be deferred until the official, company-wide communication is released.

## Conclusion

I do not underestimate the personal and professional difficulty of the task before you. This is the hardest decision a leader has to make. We are asking you to make painful choices that will impact the lives of our colleagues. However, our duty as stewards of this company is to ensure its long-term survival and eventual return to growth. The actions we take this month, as difficult as they are, will be the determining factor in our ability to navigate this downturn and emerge as a stronger, more resilient organization. I have full confidence in your ability to lead with wisdom, compassion, and strategic foresight during this challenging time.
