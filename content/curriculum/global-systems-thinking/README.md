# Global Systems Thinking

A multinational corporation is not a machine; it is a complex adaptive system. Its success depends not on managing individual parts, but on understanding the dynamic relationships, feedback loops, and second-order effects that govern the whole. The CEO's job is to be the architect and chief regulator of this global system.
