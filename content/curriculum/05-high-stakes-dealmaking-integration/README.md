# High-Stakes Dealmaking & Integration

A major transaction is not a financial event; it is the most potent and dangerous tool for executing corporate strategy. Success is not defined by closing the deal, but by creating tangible, long-term, per-share value years after the ink is dry. The CEO is the ultimate owner of this entire process, from thesis to results.
