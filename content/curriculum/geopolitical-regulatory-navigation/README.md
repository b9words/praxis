# Geopolitical & Regulatory Navigation

A multinational corporation is a non-state actor operating within a system designed by and for nation-states. The CEO must not view the geopolitical and regulatory landscape as a mere 'risk factor' or a matter for the legal department, but as a primary strategic arena. Success requires understanding the deep-seated interests of global powers and integrating that understanding into every major corporate decision.
