# Investor & Market Narrative Control

The CEO of a public company has two jobs: 1) Run the business to create long-term intrinsic value, and 2) Persuade the market to recognize that value. These two jobs are inextricably linked. Narrative control is not about hype or short-term stock promotion; it is the art of educating investors, managing expectations, and building the deep, long-term credibility that underpins a premium valuation.
