# Organizational Design & Talent Density

The goal of organizational design is not to create a tidy org chart, but to build a system that maximizes the velocity and quality of decision-making. This system is fueled by talent density—the principle that a smaller number of high-impact individuals is exponentially more valuable than a larger number of average performers. The CEO's job is to design the machine and then staff it with the best possible people.
