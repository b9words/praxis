# Technological & Market Foresight

The future is not a destiny to be predicted, but a probability distribution to be understood. The CEO's role is not to be a futurist who is always right, but to be a strategist who is prepared for a range of possible futures. This competency is a disciplined practice of signal detection, synthesis, and strategic betting that positions the company to win in the market of tomorrow.
