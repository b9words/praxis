# Crisis Leadership & Public Composure

A crisis is a high-consequence, high-uncertainty event that threatens the company's viability and reputation. The CEO's primary role is not to be the chief problem-solver, but to be the organization's absorber of uncertainty and radiator of calm. Effective crisis leadership is a disciplined process of rapid assessment, decisive action, and radical transparency, all while demonstrating profound public composure.
