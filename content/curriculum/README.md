# Execemy Executive Education Curriculum

A comprehensive curriculum for developing world-class CEOs and senior executives.

## Curriculum Overview


### Mastery of Capital Allocation

Capital allocation is the process of deciding how to deploy the firm's financial resources to generate the highest possible long-term value per share. Every dollar of profit a company generates presents a five-way choice. This curriculum is the study of how to make that choice, again and again, over a decade.

**Modules:** 12 | **Lessons:** 30

### Competitive Moat Architecture

A competitive moat is a structural advantage that protects a company from competitors, allowing it to sustain high returns on invested capital over a long period. The CEO's job is not just to compete, but to architect these moats, making the business durably difficult to assail.

**Modules:** 9 | **Lessons:** 24

### Global Systems Thinking

A multinational corporation is not a machine; it is a complex adaptive system. Its success depends not on managing individual parts, but on understanding the dynamic relationships, feedback loops, and second-order effects that govern the whole. The CEO's job is to be the architect and chief regulator of this global system.

**Modules:** 7 | **Lessons:** 19

### Organizational Design & Talent Density

The goal of organizational design is not to create a tidy org chart, but to build a system that maximizes the velocity and quality of decision-making. This system is fueled by talent density—the principle that a smaller number of high-impact individuals is exponentially more valuable than a larger number of average performers. The CEO's job is to design the machine and then staff it with the best possible people.

**Modules:** 8 | **Lessons:** 21

### High-Stakes Dealmaking & Integration

A major transaction is not a financial event; it is the most potent and dangerous tool for executing corporate strategy. Success is not defined by closing the deal, but by creating tangible, long-term, per-share value years after the ink is dry. The CEO is the ultimate owner of this entire process, from thesis to results.

**Modules:** 9 | **Lessons:** 27

### Investor & Market Narrative Control

The CEO of a public company has two jobs: 1) Run the business to create long-term intrinsic value, and 2) Persuade the market to recognize that value. These two jobs are inextricably linked. Narrative control is not about hype or short-term stock promotion; it is the art of educating investors, managing expectations, and building the deep, long-term credibility that underpins a premium valuation.

**Modules:** 8 | **Lessons:** 21

### Geopolitical & Regulatory Navigation

A multinational corporation is a non-state actor operating within a system designed by and for nation-states. The CEO must not view the geopolitical and regulatory landscape as a mere 'risk factor' or a matter for the legal department, but as a primary strategic arena. Success requires understanding the deep-seated interests of global powers and integrating that understanding into every major corporate decision.

### Crisis Leadership & Public Composure

A crisis is a high-consequence, high-uncertainty event that threatens the company's viability and reputation. The CEO's primary role is not to be the chief problem-solver, but to be the organization's absorber of uncertainty and radiator of calm. Effective crisis leadership is a disciplined process of rapid assessment, decisive action, and radical transparency, all while demonstrating profound public composure.

**Modules:** 7 | **Lessons:** 20

### Second-Order Decision Making

First-order thinking is simplistic and superficial; it seeks a single answer to a problem. Second-order thinking is deep, complex, and consequential; it seeks to understand the entire system of effects. While anyone can be trained for first-order thinking, the CEO's primary value lies in their ability to consistently anticipate and navigate the second and third-order consequences of the company's most important decisions.

**Modules:** 7 | **Lessons:** 19

### Technological & Market Foresight

The future is not a destiny to be predicted, but a probability distribution to be understood. The CEO's role is not to be a futurist who is always right, but to be a strategist who is prepared for a range of possible futures. This competency is a disciplined practice of signal detection, synthesis, and strategic betting that positions the company to win in the market of tomorrow.
