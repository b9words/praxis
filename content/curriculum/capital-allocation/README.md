# Mastery of Capital Allocation

Capital allocation is the process of deciding how to deploy the firm's financial resources to generate the highest possible long-term value per share. Every dollar of profit a company generates presents a five-way choice. This curriculum is the study of how to make that choice, again and again, over a decade.
