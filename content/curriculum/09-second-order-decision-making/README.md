# Second-Order Decision Making

First-order thinking is simplistic and superficial; it seeks a single answer to a problem. Second-order thinking is deep, complex, and consequential; it seeks to understand the entire system of effects. While anyone can be trained for first-order thinking, the CEO's primary value lies in their ability to consistently anticipate and navigate the second and third-order consequences of the company's most important decisions.
