Year 1 Scope Gating

This directory contains all curriculum content. Currently, only Year 1 content is visible to users.

Year 1 content is defined in content/year1-slugs.json, which includes:
- Articles (from year1_*.sql files)
- Lessons (from Year 1 domains: capital-allocation, second-order-decision-making, competitive-moat-architecture)
- Case studies (all case studies are currently included)

Content loaders automatically filter to Year 1 content only. All original content remains intact - nothing has been deleted.

To expand scope in the future, update content/year1-slugs.json and regenerate using scripts/generate-year1-allowlist.ts
