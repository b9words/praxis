This deal is up for renewal in 2019. Netflix has indicated a willingness to increase this substantially, potentially to over $500M/year. Forfeiting this revenue stream to launch our own service represents a significant, guaranteed hit to operating income for the foreseeable future.\n\nKey Financial Implications:\n- Current Netflix deal: $350M/year (95% margin)\n- Potential renewal: $500M+/year\n- DTC service costs: $4B+ investment over 3 years\n- Break-even timeline: 5-7 years (optimistic scenario)\n\nRecommendation: Carefully weigh the guaranteed high-margin revenue against the uncertain returns of a DTC strategy."

They are increasingly using our content to build their platform, which they will then leverage to outbid us for new creative talent.\n\nKey Market Trends:\n- Cable/Satellite subscribers declining 3-5% annually\n- Netflix subscribers growing 25%+ annually\n- SVOD market projected to reach 200M+ US subscribers by 2025\n- Content costs inflating 15-20% annually\n- Netflix content budget: $6B (2017) â†’ $15B+ (projected 2020)\n\nStrategic Risk: Netflix is using our content to fund their war chest against us."
