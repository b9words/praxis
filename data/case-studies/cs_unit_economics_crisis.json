The VCs are getting nervous, and we need to present a clear path forward or risk a down-round or worse.\n\n## Current Team Positions\n\n**My Position (CEO):** \"We need to grow faster to hit Series B metrics. Let's increase marketing spend and accelerate customer acquisition. Growth solves everything.\"\n\n**Mike's Position (CTO):** \"We're scaling too fast. Our infrastructure costs are completely out of control. We need to optimize our technical stack before we can grow sustainably.\"\n\n**James's Position (VP Sales):** \"Our sales team is crushing it. We just need more leads. The problem isn't our sales process—it's marketing not generating enough qualified prospects.\"\n\n## What I Need from You\n\nAs our Finance & Operations Manager, you have the analytical skills to cut through the noise. I need you to:\n\n1. **Analyze the root causes** of our unit economics problem\n2. **Evaluate each team's proposed solution** with hard data\n3. **Recommend immediate actions** for the next 30-90 days\n4. **Present strategic options** for the board to consider\n\n## Board's Key Concerns\n\n- **Runway:** We have 5.8 months left at current burn\n- **Unit Economics:** LTV:CAC of 1.5:1 is unsustainable\n- **Churn:** 8% monthly churn is destroying our LTV\n- **Growth:** Customer acquisition has plateaued\n- **Competition:** Competitors are raising larger rounds\n\n## Success Criteria\n\nYour analysis needs to:\n- Be data-driven with specific recommendations\n- Include financial projections for each scenario\n- Address both short-term survival and long-term growth\n- Present clear trade-offs and risks\n- Give the board confidence in our path forward\n\n## Timeline\n\n- **Week 1:** Complete analysis and initial recommendations\n- **Week 2:** Refine presentation and prepare for board questions\n- **Board Meeting:** Present findings and get approval for next steps\n\nThe company's future depends on getting this right. I'm counting on your analytical rigor to help us navigate this crisis.\n\n---\n*This memo contains confidential CloudSync information.*"
