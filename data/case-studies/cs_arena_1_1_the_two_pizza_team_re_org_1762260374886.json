While the desire for speed is understandable, framing this as a structural problem is a misdiagnosis. The issue is not our matrix organization, which ensures quality and consistency; it's a chronic underinvestment in the foundational platforms and tools that enable scaled development.\n\nBreaking our organization into small, autonomous 'squads' would be a catastrophic mistake. It would lead to rampant technical debt, duplicated work, and a chaotic user experience. Instead, I propose we double down on what works: creating more specialized, centralized 'horizontal' teams for SRE, Security, and Core Infrastructure. This will create true leverage, not chaos."
