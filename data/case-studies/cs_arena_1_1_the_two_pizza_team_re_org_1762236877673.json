I've been giving our recent delivery challenges considerable thought and believe I have a clear diagnosis. The root cause of our slowdown is not our engineering structure, which has successfully scaled our platform's reliability and quality. Instead, the issues stem from an immature product management function and poorly defined cross-functional processes.\n\nI propose we launch a 6-month, cross-functional initiative focused on improving documentation standards, meeting hygiene, and our ticketing/JIRA protocols. A disruptive re-org would be a mistake; it would create chaos, threaten quality, and demoralize my most senior engineers who thrive in the current structure. Let's fix the process before we blow up the organization."
