I believe this is a reactive, emotionally-driven decision that ignores critical data and risks significant long-term damage.\n\nMy primary concerns are as follows:\n\n1.  **Financial Irresponsibility:** We have an $8M remaining liability on our 10-year HQ lease. Abandoning this investment is fiscally reckless. The cost of flying teams in for quarterly on-sites will likely negate any real estate savings.\n\n2.  **Erosion of Innovation:** You can't schedule serendipity. Key features for our 'Odyssey' and 'Phoenix' products originated from spontaneous whiteboard conversations between teams at HQ. Shifting to a fully remote, asynchronous model will sterilize our creative process and slow our innovation velocity.\n\n3.  **Performative Symbolism:** Forcing executives out of their offices is a symbolic stunt that degrades leadership authority and creates logistical chaos for those of us who handle sensitive, confidential information daily. It will be seen as performative, not substantive, by the rank-and-file.\n\nI urge you to advise the CEO to delay this announcement and form a cross-functional task force to find a data-driven compromise that preserves a significant office presence."
