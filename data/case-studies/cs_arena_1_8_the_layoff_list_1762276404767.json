We must protect this revenue stream to fund operations and extend our runway.\n2.  **Secure the Future:** The Odyssey Project is our path to long-term relevance. We must ensure it launches on schedule and meets its ambitious goals.\n\nThese priorities are not in conflict; they are symbiotic. The Legacy Platform funds Odyssey's development.
