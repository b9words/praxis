  "description": "As CEO of Pinnacle Manufacturing, you're sitting on $1.2B in cash. Your risk-averse CFO is pushing for a quarterly dividend, but you believe a flexible share buyback is the superior path to long-term value. You must critique his proposal and build a compelling, data-driven alternative before the next board meeting.",
