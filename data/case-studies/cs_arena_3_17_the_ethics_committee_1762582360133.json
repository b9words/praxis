  "title": "The Ethics Committee: Project Janus",
  "description": "### Executive Summary\n\nYou are the Executive Vice President of Product & Strategy at Aura Cognition, Inc., a leading enterprise AI firm facing market stagnation. A breakthrough facial recognition technology, Project Janus, has emerged from your R&D division, attracting a potential $500 million contract from a national law enforcement consortium. This deal could single-handedly reignite the company's growth and restore investor confidence. However, it is fraught with peril. The internal AI Ethics Board has issued a dire 'Code Red' warning, citing extreme risks of algorithmic bias, potential for misuse in suppressing civil liberties, and the certainty of a severe public and media backlash. You must navigate the intense internal conflict between the aggressive sales team and the principled ethics board, analyze conflicting data, and formulate a definitive recommendation for the Board of Directors. Your decision will not only determine the fate of a half-billion-dollar contract but will also define the ethical character and strategic future of Aura Cognition.\n\n### Company Context\n\nAura Cognition, Inc. (Ticker: AURA) was once the darling of the enterprise AI sector. For a decade, its machine learning platforms, which helped Fortune 500 companies optimize supply chains and predict consumer behavior, drove explosive growth and a soaring stock price. With a current market capitalization of $5 billion, Aura is a major player, but the market's perception has shifted. The core B2B analytics products that fueled its rise have matured, and revenue growth has slowed to single digits. Competitors are catching up, and the narrative on Wall Street has changed from 'innovative disruptor' to 'mature tech firm.' The pressure from institutional investors and the board for a 'second act'—a new, high-growth engine—is immense and palpable in every senior leadership meeting. The company has invested heavily in its elite R&D division, 'Skunkworks,' as the source of this next wave of innovation, but it has yet to yield a commercial blockbuster. The corporate culture is a tense mix of its academic, research-driven roots and a newer, more aggressive sales-led mentality required by its status as a public company.\n\n### The Current Situation and Dilemma\n\nSkunkworks has delivered what could be that second act. 'Project Janus' is a facial recognition system with unprecedented capabilities, achieving 99.5% accuracy in chaotic, low-light, and crowded environments—an order of magnitude better than any known competitor. Seeing a massive market opportunity, the Global Sales team, led by the formidable Jian Li, has moved aggressively. Without broad internal consensus, they have secured a non-binding letter of intent (LOI) from a national law enforcement consortium for a five-year, $500 million exclusive licensing deal. This contract would be the largest in Aura's history, immediately solving its growth problem and sending its stock price soaring. Simultaneously, Dr. Marcus Thorne, the highly respected Head of AI Ethics, has submitted his team's preliminary review. The report is a 'Code Red' assessment, detailing how the model exhibits statistically significant bias against certain minority demographics, a flaw that could lead to wrongful arrests. It warns of the technology's potential for mass surveillance, suppression of dissent, and the inevitable, catastrophic brand damage that would follow a public scandal, citing the fate of competitors who have stumbled in this arena. The central tension is therefore a classic and severe business dilemma: you must choose between the immense, tangible short-term financial gain and shareholder value represented by the Janus contract, and the profound, potentially company-ending ethical, reputational, and societal risks of deploying this powerful technology.\n\n### Decision Alternatives and Constraints\n\nYour role as EVP of Product & Strategy places you at the epicenter of this conflict. The CEO has tasked you with making the definitive recommendation to the Board's Ethics Committee. There are three primary strategic paths, each with its own coalition of internal supporters and detractors: 1. **Conditional Go:** Approve the deal but attempt to mitigate the risk through unprecedented ethical safeguards, contractual limitations on use, and radical transparency. This path seeks to capture the financial upside while managing the downside, but it risks satisfying no one and failing to prevent misuse. 2. **Definitive No-Go:** Reject the law enforcement contract entirely. This path prioritizes ethical principles and long-term brand preservation above short-term profit. It would placate the ethics team and align with Aura's stated values but would also mean writing off the significant R&D investment and facing the immediate wrath of investors and the sales organization. 3. **Strategic Pivot:** Reject the law enforcement deal but immediately launch an initiative to productize Janus for a less controversial commercial market, such as secure logistics or identity verification for financial services. This 'third way' attempts to salvage the technology and find an alternative growth story, but it requires further investment and carries significant market risk with no guaranteed payoff. Your decision is constrained by a tight timeline: the consortium needs a commitment in 90 days, and the Q3 earnings call is just ten days after that, where the CEO must present a credible growth plan.\n\n### Risks and Implications\n\nThe stakes extend far beyond the $500 million contract. Choosing to proceed with the deal risks a public scandal that could destroy customer trust across all of Aura's business lines, trigger employee walkouts (especially among top AI talent), and invite crippling government regulation. The stock price could collapse overnight, far outweighing the value of the contract. Conversely, killing the deal outright could be perceived by shareholders as a fiduciary failure, sacrificing guaranteed revenue for abstract principles. It may lead to the departure of your entire high-performing sales team and signal to the market that Aura lacks the commercial will to compete. Pivoting to a new market is a gamble; it may be seen as an elegant solution or a costly, indecisive delay. Your final recommendation to the board must be a masterclass in strategic governance, weighing quantifiable financial models against unquantifiable ethical risks and demonstrating a clear vision for the company's future.",

The deck must detail the specific contractual clauses, audit rights, and transparency measures you propose. It frames the decision as an opportunity for Aura to set a new industry standard for responsible AI deployment. Pro: Aims for the best-case scenario of winning the contract and leading the industry. Con: The credibility of the entire plan rests on the board's belief that your proposed safeguards are truly effective and enforceable."

It must use the risk analysis data to argue that the potential loss from a scandal far outweighs the contract's value. The deck must also present a credible (if less spectacular) plan to reinvigorate the core business. Pro: It's the safest path from a reputational standpoint and takes a strong moral position. Con: You must be extremely persuasive to convince the board to walk away from guaranteed, company-changing revenue."

It briefly explains why the law enforcement deal is too risky and then dedicates the bulk of the slides to a compelling, data-driven business case for pivoting the Janus technology to a new, specified commercial market. It includes a projected P&L, investment requirements, and timeline. Pro: It offers a proactive, positive alternative to a simple 'yes' or 'no.' Con: You are asking the board to trade a bird in the hand ($500M LOI) for one in the bush (an unproven business plan)."
