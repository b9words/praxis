  "description": "As the new CEO of Momentum Machines, you've inherited a stagnating core business and a dozen expensive 'moonshot' projects championed by the founder, who is now your Chairman. Your first board meeting is in 10 days, and you must intervene to critique a dangerously optimistic draft presentation, forcing a strategic shift before it's too late.",
