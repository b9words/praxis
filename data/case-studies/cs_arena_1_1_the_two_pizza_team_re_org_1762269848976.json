They join us with a mandate to help us reclaim our Day 1 agility. We need to break down silos, empower our teams, and dramatically increase the speed at which we deliver value to our customers. I have tasked them with presenting a bold plan to do just that. Let's get back to building!\n\n-- Anya\n\n### Memo 2\n**TO:** eng-leadership@connectsphere.com\n**FROM:** Marcus Thorne, VP of Engineering\n**SUBJECT:** Thoughts on Scaling with Discipline\n\nLeaders,\n\nAs we prepare to welcome new leadership, I want to reinforce the principles that have allowed us to scale. Our current matrix structure, while complex, ensures technical consistency and quality across our platform. I caution against the allure of 'agile fads' that can lead to technical fragmentation and chaos. Stability and discipline are not the enemies of speed; they are its foundation. Let's ensure we preserve what works as we evolve.\n\n-- Marcus"
