  "description": "As the CEO of Nexus Dynamics, you've just acquired a competitor, AgileFlow, creating a significant product overlap. The combined engineering team has proposed 'Project Unify,' an ambitious 18-month plan to merge both products. You suspect this is a strategic trap and must build a case to kill the project and forge a more decisive path forward.",
