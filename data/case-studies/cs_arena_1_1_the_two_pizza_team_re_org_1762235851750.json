The once-agile culture is now buried under a complex matrix, slowing innovation to a crawl while a nimble competitor gains ground. As the new Chief Product Officer, you must design and execute a radical 'two-pizza team' re-org to reclaim the company's competitive edge.",

They need to see a turnaround in velocity, and soon.\n\n### Memo 2: Email from Maria Flores (VP Eng) to her team (sent last week)\n**Subject: Upholding our Engineering Standards**\n\nTeam, I want to take a moment to recognize the incredible work you all do to maintain the stability and quality of our platform. Our robust processes and Centers of Excellence are what allow us to serve our enterprise customers reliably. Let's continue to uphold these high standards.\n[End of Memos]"
