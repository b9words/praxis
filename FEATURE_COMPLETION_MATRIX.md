## Critical Gaps Identified

### HIGH PRIORITY (Blocking E2E Tests)
1. **Simulation Completion Flow** - SimulationWorkspace bypasses complete endpoint
2. **Case Data Loading** - Storage path resolution may fail
3. **Profile Update Persistence** - May not save changes properly
4. **Debrief Generation** - Depends on simulation completion

### MEDIUM PRIORITY
5. **Curriculum Content** - Some lessons may be missing
6. **Error Handling** - Some API endpoints lack proper error handling
7. **Loading States** - Some components lack loading indicators

### LOW PRIORITY
8. **Performance** - Some queries could be optimized
9. **UI Polish** - Some components need styling improvements

## Test Data Requirements

### Users Needed
- [x] Test member user
- [x] Test admin user
- [x] Test editor user

### Content Needed
- [x] Published articles
- [x] Published cases
- [x] Forum channels
- [x] Sample forum threads
- [x] User progress records
- [x] Completed simulations
- [x] Generated debriefs

### Database State
- [x] Competencies seeded
- [x] User roles assigned
- [x] RLS policies enabled
- [x] Subscription data

## Next Steps for E2E Testing

1. **Fix Critical Gaps** - Address simulation completion and case loading
2. **Create Test Seed** - Comprehensive test data
3. **Implement E2E Test** - 30+ action test suite
4. **Test-Fix Cycle** - Run tests, fix errors, repeat
5. **Gemini Analysis** - Use AI to identify additional gaps
